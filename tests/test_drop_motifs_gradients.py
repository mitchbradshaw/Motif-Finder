"""
test_drop_motifs_gradients.py
==============================
Tests for the fall-gradient measurements and the circular statistics
behind the rose diagram (`Working.Detection.drop_motifs.gradients`).

Why this needs tests at all: a rose diagram is very good at looking
convincing. Every one of the quantities under it - which gradient was
measured, what the angle was divided by to become dimensionless, whether
the bins wrap, whether the "mean direction" is a circular mean or an
arithmetic one - can be wrong while the picture stays beautiful. These
tests pin each of them on inputs whose answer is known by construction.

The two that matter most:

  - `slope_angle` is only meaningful relative to a STATED reference
    slope. arctan needs a dimensionless argument, and mV/s is not one.
    A test asserts that halving the reference moves the angle, so the
    reference can never quietly default to 1.0 and be forgotten.
  - the circular mean is not the arithmetic mean. On angles straddling a
    wrap point the two differ by 180 degrees, and only one of them is
    right.
