test_end_to_end.py
====================
Ticket 48 — end-to-end test and repository cleanup.

One test walks a synthetic signal through the whole Pipeline GUI claim: a
three-step chain runs, a detection is adjudicated, the candidate is promoted
into the shape library, and the run group is exported — and the exported
manifest's recipe hash equals the run's recipe hash. A second test pins
`discover_adapters()` to the expected count so no adapter is silently skipped
by a broken optional dependency.

    per-module `get_adapter` lookup below raises.
