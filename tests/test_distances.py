===================
Contract tests for `Working.distances` (T35) — the three named,
recordable-on-an-edge distance functions between two spans' shapes:

  DISTANCE_SCALE_INVARIANT  resample both spans to a common length,
                            z-normalise, Euclidean. The primary distance.
  DISTANCE_SYMBOLIC         SAX minimum-distance (MINDIST) at a fixed
                            word length, via the existing SAX ports.
  DISTANCE_NATIVE_LENGTH    z-normalised Euclidean at native length, no
                            resampling — the unnormalised control.

The test that matters (`test_scale_invariant_is_near_zero_control_is_large`)
asserts the actual research claim: a pair identical in shape but differing
in duration is near-zero under the scale-invariant distance and large
under the control. Every other test hand-verifies one distance against an
independently worked expected value.

Pure-numpy, no database/UI. Runnable standalone:
