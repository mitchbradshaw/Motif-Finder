_calibration_isolation.py
=========================
Shared test helper: every test that triggers cost calibration must redirect
`cost.CALIBRATION_PATH` away from the real `DATA/db/*_calibration.json`
(the Panel-era `tests/_session_isolation.py` did the same for the old UI's
session file; it went with that tree on 2026-09-21, tag `archive/panel-ui`).

This replaces two divergent copies of an `_IsolatedCalibration` class that
each did:

    fd, path = tempfile.mkstemp(suffix=".json")
    os.close(fd)
    os.remove(path)          # <-- name released before it is used
    cost.CALIBRATION_PATH = path

Removing the file hands the *name* back to the OS while the test goes on to
use it, and one of the two copies never deleted the file it created. Both are
avoided here by owning a whole temp directory for the duration and pointing
the module at a path inside it: the directory guarantees the name, and the
file is absent-not-empty on entry, which is what `_load_calibration()`
expects.

Use as:

    from tests._calibration_isolation import scratch_calibration

    with scratch_calibration(cost):
        cost.calibrate()
        ...

Several modules can be isolated at once — each gets its own file:

    with scratch_calibration(wm_cost, mp_cost):
        ...
