"""The guards that decide whether a real-data test runs must skip, not return.

Ninety-eight call sites across ten files opened with:

    if not _channel_available():
        print("  (skipped: real channel data not present)")
        return

A test that returns early **reports as passed**. So with the channel data
absent, a large slice of this suite was green without executing anything, and
the numbers say how large: when the data was rematerialised on 2026-08-17 the
suite went from 152 s to 276 s and from "505 passed" to a genuinely different
505 passed. Nothing failed; the suite had simply been lying at scale.

That mattered beyond tidiness. The orchestrator gates every ticket on "no
regressions against the baseline", and both the baseline and the ticket run
were measuring the same vacuum. `runs/run-20260817-1157` merged T01 on a suite
gate that had executed zero tests.

These tests are the standing guarantee that the conversion does not quietly
regress — a `return` is one careless edit away from coming back, and nothing
else in the suite would notice.

Nine of the ten guarded files were Panel viewer tests and went with the Panel
tree on 2026-09-21 (tag `archive/panel-ui`); `test_execution.py` is the one
that remains, and any new real-data test file belongs in the tuple below.
