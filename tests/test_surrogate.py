test_surrogate.py
===================
Ticket 43 — surrogate generation block.

A signal-to-signal adapter that produces a null (surrogate) version of a
signal, reproducibly from its recipe. The PRD ("Surrogates") requires:
phase randomisation and block shuffling offered as a choice parameter, an
explicit RNG seed among the `ParamSpec` parameters so the recipe hash
reproduces the surrogate exactly, and a phase-randomised surrogate that
preserves the original's power spectrum.

These tests assert the external behaviour the reproducibility claim depends
on: the block declares `Signal -> Signal`, offers both surrogate methods as
a choice, exposes a seed parameter, reproduces a bit-identical surrogate for
a fixed seed, and phase randomisation preserves the power spectrum within a
stated tolerance.

Run from the project root:
    python -m pytest tests/test_surrogate.py -q
