"""
test_heldout_lock.py
====================
Tests for the held-out recording lock (ticket T03).

`M4_aug_concat_fs1.mat` is the evaluation recording. It is refused by both the
runner and the viewer unless the unlock flag is set, so "untouched until the
freeze" is true by construction rather than by memory.

The load-bearing test here is `test_the_guard_reads_config_not_a_literal`: a
guard that happens to name the same string as the config constant would pass
every other test in this file while being exactly the thing the ticket forbids.
It is tested by moving the config value and checking the guard moves with it.

Recordings go in through `q.insert_recording` rather than hand-written SQL --
`channel` is an integer column, and a hand-written row with a string in it
builds a database no other part of the app can read.
