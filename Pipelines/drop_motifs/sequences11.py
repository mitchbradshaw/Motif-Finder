===============
Task S3.0. A sequence is a run of consecutive events on one channel that
is regular enough to read as a progression rather than as scattered
detections. Section 3's figures all select from what this module writes,
never by hand.

Two steps, and both thresholds are per-group
---------------------------------------------
Step 1, SPLIT. Within each (catalogue_id, channel) group, order by onset
and cut wherever the gap exceeds `GAP_MULTIPLE` (2.0) times that group's
OWN median inter-event interval. Per group, not global: Reishi's median
interval is 2.3 s and Oyster's is 192 s, so one global gap threshold would
either cut every Reishi run into singletons or never cut an Oyster one.
Runs of at least `MIN_RUN` (5) events are kept.

Step 2, GATE ON REGULARITY. A run qualifies on either arm:

  constant gap   coefficient of variation of its intervals <= CV_MAX (0.5)
  constant rate  R-squared of interval against event index >= R2_MIN (0.7)
     of change

The two arms are recorded SEPARATELY and not merged into one count. On
this store the trend arm alone qualifies a handful of runs where the
constant-gap arm qualifies over a hundred, and if ramping sequences really
are that rare it is a finding for Section 3, not something to hide inside
a combined total.

Drift, which is the point of Section 3
---------------------------------------
"Near-constant gap" can still mean systematically wider at the end than at
the start. For every constant-gap run the ratio of its last third's mean
interval to its first third's is recorded, and runs beyond +/-`DRIFT_MARK`
(20%) are marked. That slow widening is exactly the morphing Section 3 is
about, so it is measured rather than assumed absent.

No plotting here; `figures11_s3` draws from `sequences.csv`.
