=============
Tasks 4 and 5. Two small, self-contained analyses over the refined store.

TASK 4 - A STATED RULE FOR THE NUMBER OF FAMILIES
--------------------------------------------------
k = 4 is currently a cut, not a decision. No cluster-derived number should
be quoted without a criterion, so the criterion is written down here, in
code, ABOVE the code that evaluates it, and the answer is read off
afterwards:

    SELECTION_RULE - maximise mean silhouette over k in 2..12; break ties
    toward the smaller k.

Silhouette rather than the gap statistic as the primary because the gap
statistic's uniform reference is a poor null for 200-dimensional
z-normalised vectors: a uniform box in that space is nothing like the thin
shell the normalisation constrains the data to, so the gap is measuring
"is this data on a sphere" as much as "how many clusters". It is computed
and reported anyway, because it is the conventional companion number and
its disagreement with silhouette is informative.

Cophenetic correlation is a property of the LINKAGE, not of k. It is
reported once, and the figure says so rather than plotting it against k as
though it varied.

The known tension from earlier work, carried here so the result is read
against it rather than in isolation: Ward over PCA gave silhouette 0.238
at k = 5 with cophenetic r 0.52, while average linkage gave cophenetic
r 0.91 but suggested k = 2. IF THE CRITERION SELECTS k = 2, k = 2 IS
REPORTED. A smaller repertoire is better for the argument, not worse.

TASK 5 - SEQUENCE STRUCTURE
----------------------------
Everything needed is already a column: `onset_idx`, `fs`, `channel`,
`drop_depth_mv`, `fall_duration_s`, `cluster_id`. Four statistics, and the
one that carries the weight is the last:

    CV of the ISI distribution, per channel. CV = 1 is Poisson; below 1 is
    more regular than Poisson, above 1 is bursting. It is the standard
    regularity statistic and it separates the draft's "shark-fin train"
    from its "icicle train" with one number each.

The archetype check is deliberately conservative. Twenty minutes at 10 Hz
is a short recording, and `archetype_verdict` is written to return "not
visible" unless a stated numeric condition is met, so that absence is
reported as absence rather than as a hedge.
