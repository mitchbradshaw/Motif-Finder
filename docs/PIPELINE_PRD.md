# Pipeline GUI — Product Spec

**Project:** Underground Brains — mycelium bio-electric signal analysis
**Status:** Design settled via goals grilling and design grilling. Ready for ticket breakdown.
**Feature freeze:** 28 August 2026 — **spent, and superseded on 2026-09-23.** The tool was still being
built through that date (stage 3, the web-UI wiring, ran 2026-09-21 onward). The live constraint is
**21 October 2026, about four weeks, to a polished and reliable Pipeline UI**, after which the tool is
used to answer the research questions rather than extended. Every date in Part 1 below — the fourteen
days to freeze, the six milestones, "five weeks after freeze" — is a record of the original plan, not a
schedule anyone is working to. The *priorities* in Part 1 still stand; its calendar does not. The
priority order now is: **workflow friction first, legibility second, completeness last.**
**Relationship to prior documents:** the goals spec (`pipelineguispec.md`) remains the authority on *what the software is for*. This spec is the authority on *how it is built*. Where the two disagree, the disagreements are marked **[CORRECTION]** and this document wins — each one was made after reading the existing codebase.

## Problem Statement

Open-ended exploratory time-series analysis on this project has no structure.

Every technique found in the literature — Gramian encoding into CNN training, matrix profiling into motif discovery, wavelet decomposition into segmentation — arrives as an isolated script. There is no way to navigate between analysis structures, to combine them, or to feed the output of one into the input of another. Past analyses are not saved in any form that can be revisited, compared, or reapplied to a new recording. A promising result is discovered and then lost, because the parameters and the ordering that produced it were never captured as an object that could be re-run.

The consequence for the research is concrete and expensive: findings cannot be reliably compared across methods or across recordings, and every new dataset restarts the work from zero. The thesis needs to claim that recurring patterns in fungal electrical recordings can be automatically detected and characterised. Right now the evidence for that claim lives in scattered scripts, plots that cannot be regenerated, and judgements held in the researcher's head rather than in data.

There is a second, sharper problem underneath the first. The existing manual labels are the only ground truth available, and they are single-rater and subjective. If machine-derived labels ever get written into the same store as human ones, the question "do cluster-derived labels beat manual labels?" becomes permanently unanswerable. That is a one-way door, and nothing currently prevents walking through it.

## Solution

One application that loads a univariate recording, lets the researcher compose typed analysis blocks into chains, run them over a whole channel or a selected span, adjudicate the results by hand, and save the chain as a reusable template.

Results that survive adjudication accumulate into a **motif library**: a persistent, cross-recording catalogue of exemplar shapes with everything matched to them, queryable by shape, by cluster membership, or by human tag, where every match carries the distance function, threshold and recipe that produced it.

The library is the deliverable. Templates are how it gets populated. Exports are how it gets communicated.

Three properties make it trustworthy rather than merely convenient:

- **Detections are candidates, never results.** Nothing enters the library without human adjudication, and human and analytical judgement are stored in physically separate tables so neither can contaminate the other.
- **Every result carries a null.** Surrogate testing runs by default on every analysis, so "we found motifs" upgrades to "we found more motifs than chance" without anyone remembering to do it.
- **Every chain is reproducible.** A recipe hash identifies the exact parameters and ordering that produced any run, any cached artifact, any saved plot, and any library edge.

This is an extension of the existing Panel/HoloViews annotation application, not a new program. The signal viewer, the span selection, the controlled tag vocabulary, the recipe/hash provenance layer and the twenty working algorithm adapters are the assets being preserved. The layout above them is redesigned around the research loop: explore, analyse, adjudicate, catalogue.

## User Stories

**Viewing and annotating**

1. As a researcher, I want to load a univariate recording and view it at any zoom level, so that I can navigate long multi-hour signals without downsampling artifacts hiding structure.
2. As a researcher, I want to see previously recorded regions of interest overlaid on the signal, so that prior work is visible in context rather than in a separate file.
3. As a researcher, I want to select a span of signal and run an analysis on just that span, so that I can experiment cheaply before committing to a full-recording run.
4. As a researcher, I want to mark a region I find interesting by eye even when no algorithm flagged it, so that analytical blind spots are documented rather than invisible.
5. As a researcher, I want to mark a region as a seed exemplar directly from the viewer, so that a shape I recognise by eye can anchor a library entry without an algorithm having proposed it first.

**Composing analyses**

6. As a researcher, I want to compose analysis blocks into a chain where the output of one becomes the input of the next, so that multi-stage workflows are first-class objects rather than sequences of scripts.
7. As a researcher, I want the application to prevent me from connecting incompatible blocks, so that invalid chains fail at composition time rather than after a long run.
8. As a researcher, I want to be told *why* two blocks cannot connect, so that the type system teaches me its shape as I use it instead of just refusing.
9. As a researcher, I want a block to be able to take an extra input besides the previous step's output — the original signal, an earlier step's result, or a library exemplar — so that seeded search and comparison against the raw trace are expressible as chains.
10. As a researcher, I want to open a single block and see its parameters, its inputs, and its results, so that I can tune one stage without rerunning the whole chain.
11. As a researcher, I want parameter defaults that adapt to the span I am about to analyse, so that a fixed default is not silently wrong for most spans.
12. As a researcher, I want a live readout of what a parameter will actually produce before I run anything, so that a control whose effect I cannot picture becomes legible.
13. As a researcher, I want to save a chain — ordering and parameters — as a named template, so that I can apply the same analysis to a different recording.
14. As a researcher, I want to run a saved template against a recording it has never seen, so that I can test whether a workflow generalises.
15. As a researcher, I want to choose, when saving a template, whether an exemplar travels with it or is re-picked on each use, so that "reapply this exact search" and "reapply this method" are different saved things.

**Running**

16. As a researcher, I want to run a chain across a selection of channels in one action, so that a sixteen-channel sweep is not sixteen manual launches.
17. As a researcher, I want to run a chain across a list of frequency bands in one action, so that band decomposition is the same mechanism as channel fan-out rather than a special case.
18. As a researcher, I want to see an estimate of how long a run will take before I start it, so that I can decide between running locally and sending it to the cluster.
19. As a researcher, I want the application to route expensive runs to a cluster job by default, so that I do not accidentally freeze my laptop for six hours.
20. As a researcher, I want a progress indicator with a rough time estimate on longer local runs, so that I can tell a slow run from a hung one.
21. As a researcher, I want each stage's result to appear as it completes, so that I can inspect an early stage without waiting for the whole chain.
22. As a researcher, I want to cancel a running chain, so that a mistaken launch does not have to run to completion.
23. As a researcher, I want a cluster job's results to import back into my local database in one action, so that work done remotely is not stranded there.
24. As a researcher, I want retuning one stage of a chain to reuse the expensive stages before it, so that parameter exploration is not gated on recomputing a matrix profile every time.

**Adjudicating**

25. As a researcher, I want algorithmic detections presented to me as candidates rather than as results, so that nothing enters the library without human adjudication.
26. As a researcher, I want to score a candidate as a seed exemplar, as a real instance, as uninteresting, as an artifact, or as unsure, so that my judgement is recorded as data rather than as a mental note.
27. As a researcher, I want to score candidates with single keystrokes and advance automatically, so that adjudicating hundreds of candidates is a session rather than a project.
28. As a researcher, I want to undo my last verdict, so that a mis-keyed judgement is not permanent.
29. As a researcher, I want human scores and analytical scores stored separately, so that neither can contaminate the other.
30. As a researcher, I want to query the set of candidates where human and analytical judgement disagree, so that divergence becomes a measurable finding.
31. As a researcher, I want to filter the candidate queue by run, method, score range and channel, so that I can adjudicate one method's output at a time rather than an undifferentiated pile.
32. As a researcher, I want to promote an adjudicated candidate into the library as an exemplar, so that scoring and cataloguing are one continuous motion.

**The library**

33. As a researcher, I want to browse a library of motif exemplars as thumbnails, so that I can see the shape vocabulary at a glance.
34. As a researcher, I want to click an exemplar and see every span matched to it, so that a motif family is inspectable as a set.
35. As a researcher, I want to group the library by shape, by cluster membership, or by manual tag, so that I can compare what each grouping basis produces over the same underlying entries.
36. As a researcher, I want to see which recordings and which channels a motif family appears in, so that recurrence has a scope.
37. As a researcher, I want stored similarity edges to record the distance function, threshold, and recipe that produced them, so that a family is a reproducible object rather than a screenshot.
38. As a researcher, I want to search for instances of a motif at durations it was not defined at, so that scale-invariance is testable rather than assumed.

**Controls and confounds**

39. As a researcher, I want to generate surrogate versions of a signal and run an identical chain over them, so that every result has a null.
40. As a researcher, I want the surrogate control to run by default rather than on request, so that a missing null is impossible rather than merely unlikely.
41. As a researcher, I want surrogate generation to be reproducible from its recipe, so that a reported null can be regenerated exactly.
42. As a researcher, I want cross-channel matches classified by inter-channel lag and waveform identity, so that a shared-ground artifact is not counted as a finding.
43. As a researcher, I want two runs compared by set overlap, so that "does the banded chain find things the direct chain misses" is a question the tool answers.

**Getting results out**

44. As a researcher, I want to export a completed chain's structure, parameters, and results as structured data plus saved plots, so that results can go into the thesis without re-running anything.
45. As a researcher, I want to export a library entry with its members, edges and scope, so that a motif family can be reported as a table rather than a description.
46. As a researcher, I want exports to record the code version that produced them, so that a result traces to a state of the repository.
47. As another researcher, I want to run an exported template on my own recording, so that the work is reproducible outside the original machine.

**Protecting the evaluation**

48. As a researcher, I want the held-out recording to be refused by the viewer and the runner until I explicitly unlock it, so that "untouched until the freeze" is enforced by the code rather than by my memory.

**Extending it**

49. As a researcher, I want to add a new analysis technique by writing a single class conforming to a declared interface, so that future methods do not require touching the application.

## Implementation Decisions

### Boundary and reuse

The pipeline extends the existing application. The following are reused as they stand, not rebuilt: the adapter registry and its parameter-spec system; the headless recipe executor with its hash-based idempotence, cancellation and per-step progress; the canonical-JSON recipe hashing; the SQLite schema and query layer; the SLURM job generator; the rasterized signal viewer and every plot builder in the UI plotting module; matrix profiling on STUMPY; the motif-group precompute; the window matrix; the Gramian/recurrence encoders; the SAX ports; the CNN and Catch22 classifiers; ruptures, kymatio and aeon integrations; and the 195 existing tests.

A hard rule already present in the codebase is preserved and load-bearing: **no module below the UI layer imports a UI library.** This is what makes cluster execution, headless testing and the reproducibility story possible.

Three libraries named in the goals spec are deliberately **not** adopted. **pyts** is rejected because the existing hand-rolled Gramian and recurrence encoders produce exactly the images every trained model expects, and substituting them risks a silent encoding mismatch. **MNE-Python** is rejected as a dependency but adopted as a *vocabulary* — its onset/duration/description annotation semantics and its epoch semantics inform the schema naming and give the thesis a defensible reason for the data model. **dtaianomaly** remains an architectural reference only.

**[CORRECTION]** The goals spec proposed rewriting block parameters as Param `Parameterized` classes. This is reversed. The existing parameter-spec system already generates the parameter UI *and* carries span-aware default recommendation and live derived readouts, neither of which Param provides. The adapter spec is extended instead of replaced.

### Type system

Seven interchange types gate which blocks may connect: `Signal` (series plus sample rate), `SpanSet` (regions of interest, optionally labelled and scored), `WindowSet` (fixed-length segments, optionally carrying an attached per-window feature matrix), `Encoding` (image or symbolic representation per window), `Grouping` (cluster or class assignment over a window set), `Model` (a trained classifier), and `Scores` (a time-aligned profile, one value per timepoint).

The critical distinction is that `Scores` is time-aligned, which is what makes a single generic "threshold a Scores to obtain a SpanSet" block possible. A window matrix is **not** a `Scores` — it is a feature table with one row per window and no timepoint alignment, and it rides as attached features on a `WindowSet`. Conflating them breaks the thresholding chain.

Each type is a small frozen dataclass with disk serialisation, because the step cache needs a serialiser anyway and putting it on the type makes it free. Arrays serialise to compressed numpy archives, feature tables to parquet, span sets to JSON, models by path reference.

Any method that does not fit these seven types is out of scope, rather than a reason to add an eighth.

**A latent bug is fixed as part of this work:** the matrix profile adapter currently declares an `encoding` output while what it actually produces is a time-aligned score profile. It is remapped to `Scores`.

### Block contract

The adapter spec gains three fields and loses none: a declared `input_kind`, a list of typed `side_inputs` (each naming its type and the sources it may be bound to), and an optional `estimate` callable returning predicted runtime in seconds. The existing output-kind enumeration is replaced by the seven type names, and all twenty existing adapters are remapped.

Adding a technique remains what the goals spec promised: one new adapter file declaring its types, parameters and run function. The block set stays **curated, not open** — the declared contract is the plugin mechanism; there is no third-party registry.

### Chain shape

A chain is a **linear spine with named side-inputs**. Each step draws its primary input from the previous step, and may declare additional typed inputs bound at composition time to the chain's root signal, an earlier step's output, or a library exemplar. There is no fan-out within a chain and no merges. **[SUPERSEDED by Part 2 — "Chain shape, revised".** The chain is still a linear spine; Part 2 replaces only how that spine is *presented*, from a vertical staged list to a horizontal block canvas. The prohibition on fan-out and merges stands.**]** Comparing two chains is a Compare action over two completed runs — the same mechanism surrogate comparison requires, so one implementation serves two research questions.

Side-input bindings serialise into the step and are **hashed by content, not by database identifier**: a binding records the entry id as a convenience pointer alongside the source file, channel and sample range that constitute its actual identity. This keeps a recipe hash stable when local identifiers change and lets an exported template resolve on another machine.

### Type checking

A single chain-validation function answers "can this output type feed this block, and if not, why not." It is consumed at two layers. At composition, the add-step control lists every block with incompatible ones disabled and the reason stated inline. **[SUPERSEDED by Part 2 — the reasons now surface in a picker opened from a `+` on the canvas, not in a permanent vertical list. The rule that incompatible blocks are *disabled with a reason* rather than hidden is unchanged, and is the part that matters.]** At execution, recipe construction and the runner both hard-fail before any computation, so a hand-edited or cluster-generated recipe cannot get partway through a long run before failing. Two layers, one function, no possibility of drift.

### Storage

**[CORRECTION]** An earlier design unified human annotations and machine detections into one span table with an origin discriminator. This is reversed. The existing schema already separates them physically — annotations are human-only, detections are machine-only and foreign-keyed to runs — and that structural separation is a stronger guarantee than a discriminator column, because there is no column into which a machine write could place a human verdict. It also avoids migrating roughly eleven thousand existing annotation rows.

The database remains one SQLite file accessed through plain SQL with no ORM, extended additively by numbered migrations applied at startup, consistent with the existing pattern. Bulk arrays never enter the database; they live on disk referenced by path.

New tables:

- **`adjudications`** — a human verdict against a machine detection, one per detection, with a note and a tag join table. This is where human judgement of algorithmic output lives, and it is the only such place.
- **`v_spans`** — a view unioning annotations and detections with an origin column, so every read surface (viewer overlay, library, divergence queries) has one read path while writes stay physically separated.
- **`motif_entry` / `motif_member` / `motif_edge`** — the shape-first library. An entry is an exemplar span identified by recording and sample range, with optional provenance pointers to the detection or annotation it came from. A member is any span matched to it, in **any** recording and **any** channel. An edge carries the distance function, threshold, distance value, recipe hash, and — for cross-channel members — inter-channel lag, waveform correlation and classification bin. Tags attach many-to-many to entries and are never the primary key.
- **`run_groups`** — N sibling runs sharing one recipe, fanned out over a channel list or a band list.
- **`step_artifacts`** — the per-step cache, keyed on the hash of the recipe prefix up to and including that step.
- **`templates`** — saved chains with recording and span stripped.

Changes to existing tables: the annotation verdict constraint gains `seed`; runs gain a run-group reference and a surrogate-pairing reference.

**Why shape-first matters, concretely.** The existing motif table is keyed to a detection, and a detection belongs to one run, and a run is bound to one recording. Under that model a library entry is tethered to the recording it was found in, there is nowhere to record a second span that matched it, no column holds the distance or threshold that produced a match, and a shape spotted by eye can never be an exemplar at all. Making the entry a span instead of a detection is what makes cross-recording membership, persisted edges, and eye-flagged exemplars expressible. Existing motif rows migrate in as entries retaining their detection pointer.

### Verdict vocabulary

One vocabulary across human annotation and machine adjudication: `seed`, `interesting`, `not_interesting`, `artifact`, `unsure`. `interesting` is accept; `not_interesting` is reject; `seed` marks exemplar-worthy; `artifact` is retained as first-class because the cross-channel contamination question needs it. A single shared vocabulary means no translation table exists between the two stores, and therefore none can drift.

### Execution

A run executes on a background thread, with its status, current step and error recorded on the run row and polled by the UI. Cancellation is cooperative and checked between steps. Each stage's result is written and rendered as it lands. A progress indicator with an estimated finish appears once the chain's predicted runtime exceeds a configured threshold; adapters that already drive a fine-grained progress callback additionally show intra-step progress.

**Step caching.** Each step's cache key is the hash of the recipe prefix up to that step, including its side-input bindings. On run, the executor walks the chain and resumes at the first step with no cached artifact. An artifact is only written when the step's measured runtime exceeds a small configured threshold, so trivial filters cost no disk while expensive stages are never recomputed to retune something downstream. No cache eviction is implemented before the freeze.

**Fan-out.** A run over multiple channels or multiple bands creates one run-group row and N run rows. Locally they execute sequentially with per-item progress; on the cluster they become a single SLURM array job whose task index selects its target from a list baked into the recipe.

**Cluster routing.** Every adapter may declare a runtime estimator; two already exist in the codebase for the expensive stages. The run panel sums the chain estimate, multiplies by fan-out width, displays it, and above a configured ceiling promotes "export cluster job" to the primary action with local execution demoted. Blocks without an estimator count as free.

**Cluster round trip.** The headless recipe runner always writes a manifest beside its artifacts: recipe, config hash, run status, step timings, detections, artifact paths, code version and timestamps. The researcher copies cluster output back into the working tree at matching relative paths and triggers a single import action, which reads any manifest and writes the corresponding local rows. One generic importer replaces the two bespoke artifact importers that exist today. The same manifest format is the export payload, so one writer and one reader serve import, export and reproducibility.

### Workspaces

Four workspaces plus an admin group replace today's seven tabs. Nine tabs would be a filing cabinet; four is the research loop.

- **Explore** — the existing viewer, essentially unchanged: rasterized zoom driven by the visible range, vectorised annotation overlays, coverage and density ribbons, drag modes, filters, keyboard shortcuts, cross-channel peek, session persistence. It gains `seed` as a fifth verdict.
- **Analyse** — absorbs the run panel, run history and window-matrix panel. Holds the chain builder (a staged list with type-filtered block addition), the block inspector (generated parameter controls, recommended defaults, live derived readouts, side-input pickers, and that step's cached result), the scope selector (recordings, channels, span, bands), the run surface (estimate, routing, progress, per-stage results, surrogate toggle), a history sidebar that can reload a past chain, and the two-run Compare view.
  **[SUPERSEDED by Part 2 — "The Analyse workspace, revised".** The chain builder becomes a horizontal block canvas; the block inspector is absorbed into the block card and ceases to exist as a separate surface; the run panel becomes a filmstrip of every step's plot; the history sidebar becomes collapsible. The surfaces named here are the *right set of jobs* — Part 2 changes which surface does which, and adds none.**]**
- **Review** — the candidate queue. Filterable by run, run group, method, score range, channel and adjudication status. One candidate at a time in context with configurable padding, its analytical score, and the z-normalised overlay pattern the motif browser already uses. Verdicts on single keys with auto-advance and undo.
- **Library** — absorbs the motif browser. A thumbnail grid of exemplars with a group-by selector and scope summary; an entry detail showing the exemplar, its members, the all-members overlay on a shared relative-time axis, and the edge list. Actions to search at other scales, classify cross-channel, and export.
- **Admin** — vocabulary administration, recording import, and cluster-job import.

**The central invariant of the Review workspace:** adjudicating a candidate writes an adjudication row against the detection and never an annotation row. Only explicit promotion creates a library entry. Regions the algorithms missed are marked in Explore as annotations. Both directions of divergence are then queryable over the union view with equal standing.

### Analysis semantics

**Distances.** Three named distance functions, each recorded on the edge it produces: a scale-invariant one (resample both spans to a common length, z-normalise, Euclidean) as the primary; a symbolic one (SAX minimum-distance at fixed word length, scale-invariant by construction through piecewise aggregation) as the second arm; and a native-length z-normalised match as the unnormalised control. Elastic distances are deferred — the cost of banded dynamic time warping across sixty-four channel-recordings does not fit the schedule, and the scale-invariance question is answerable without it. "Does this motif recur at other scales" is therefore a query: search at durations the exemplar was never defined at, and compare recall between the scale-invariant distance and the control.

**Surrogates.** Surrogate generation is a signal-to-signal block offering phase randomisation and block shuffling, with an explicit RNG seed among its parameters so the recipe hash reproduces the surrogate exactly. Every run carries a surrogate-control toggle that is **on by default**; when set, a paired run executes the identical chain with the surrogate step prepended, linked to the original by a run reference, and results are always displayed as detected-versus-surrogate counts. Exports state a null surrogate explicitly rather than omitting the field, so a missing control is visible. The surrogate signal is transient and never gets a recording row, which means nothing surrogate-derived can enter the library — it has no recording to attach a span to.

**Cross-channel classification** is a library-level action rather than a block, because the univariate signal type deliberately cannot express multi-channel input and because the classification is a statement about a motif family rather than about a signal. For each pair of members on different channels of one recording it computes inter-channel lag from the cross-correlation peak and waveform identity from the correlation at that lag, then classifies into three bins persisted on the edge: **artifact** (near-zero lag and near-identical waveform — a shared-ground recording error, excluded from counts), **propagation** (small consistent lag with waveform variation — a real network event), and **independent recurrence** (lag scattered across long intervals — counted once per instance). The artifact bin doubles as an internal control: a method that cannot separate a ground artifact from a real event has a diagnosable problem.

**Band decomposition** reuses the existing bandpass adapters. A banded chain is the same chain with a bandpass step prepended, and the band list is a fan-out scope exactly like the channel list. The comparison of direct against banded is the Compare view's set overlap, with the non-overlapping remainder adjudicated by hand.

### Export and templates

Two exporters, each writing a folder containing a manifest, a spans table as CSV, and copied plots. One exports a run group: recipe, config hash, per-run status and timings, detections with their adjudications, surrogate counts, artifact paths, code version and timestamps. The other exports a library entry: exemplar, members with their edges and distances, scope by recording and channel, cross-channel bins, tags, and the recipe behind each edge. The manifest shares its schema with the cluster-job manifest. The CSV exists because thesis tables come out of a spreadsheet, not a JSON blob.

A template is a chain's steps with recording and span stripped, stored in the database and exportable as JSON. Each side-input binding declares either *carry* (the exemplar travels with the template — reapply this exact search) or *rebind* (prompt on apply — reapply this method). Applying a template asks for recording, span and any rebinds, then constructs an ordinary recipe.

### Evaluation protection

The held-out recording is **`M4_aug_concat_fs1.mat`** — the only non-M2 network in the corpus and therefore the strongest available generalisation test. It is named in configuration, its channels are materialised so the freeze-day run is a single action, and both the viewer and the runner refuse it unless an explicit unlock flag is passed. The lock makes the methods-chapter claim true by construction rather than by memory.

**A leakage hazard to state in the thesis:** `M2_aug_concat_fs1.mat` and `M2_aug_concat_fs2.mat` are the same underlying recording at two sample rates. They must never be split across training and test.

## Testing Decisions

A good test here asserts external behaviour that a research claim depends on — that a recipe reproduces, that a cache resumes correctly, that a lagged pair classifies as an artifact — not that a particular function was called. Tests are headless. Visual inspection of the Panel surfaces stays with the researcher, deliberately: it is the review bottleneck this entire design is shaped around, and automating it is not affordable before the freeze.

**Preferred seams, highest first.** Three seams already exist in the codebase and should carry most of the new coverage rather than new ones being invented:

1. **The headless recipe executor** is the highest useful seam. It takes a recipe and a database path and returns run identity, results and timings with no UI anywhere in the chain, which makes an end-to-end assertion possible in a single call. Existing tests already exercise it; the new work extends that file rather than starting a parallel suite.
2. **The recipe hashing layer** is the reproducibility seam. Asserting that a rerun of an identical recipe yields an identical hash, an identical artifact and a reused rather than recomputed run is the concrete form of the reproducibility claim, and it needs no new infrastructure.
3. **The database initialisation function** is the migration seam. It is already written to be idempotent and additive; the new migrations must preserve that property, and the test is simply calling it twice and comparing row counts and tag links.

**Modules under test, and what each test asserts:**

- **Types** — every one of the seven round-trips through its disk serialisation unchanged, including a window set carrying an attached feature table.
- **Chain validation** — the full compatibility matrix, asserting both the boolean and the human-readable reason for each incompatible pair, plus that the three worked chains (CNN, seeded search, banded search) validate end to end.
- **Executor with cache** — changing the parameters of step *k* in an *n*-step chain recomputes steps *k* through *n* and reuses steps 0 through *k*−1, verified by artifact identity rather than by timing.
- **Migrations** — idempotence as above; specifically that the verdict-constraint rebuild preserves every annotation row and every annotation-tag link.
- **Distances** — each of the three against hand-computed cases, including one pair identical in shape but differing in duration, which must be near-zero under the scale-invariant distance and large under the control.
- **Cross-channel classification** — a synthetic pair with a known injected lag classifying into the expected bin. **This is the test to insist on.** Without it a bug in this classifier is indistinguishable from a research finding, and the finding it would fake is precisely the one an examiner will attack.
- **Surrogate generation** — a fixed seed reproducing an identical surrogate and therefore an identical null count.
- **Manifest round trip** — write a manifest, import it into an empty database, and assert the reconstructed run rows match the original.
- **End to end** — synthetic signal through a three-step chain, adjudication, promotion to the library, export; asserting the exported manifest's recipe hash matches the run's.

The 195 existing tests must continue to pass at every milestone. That constraint is doing real work here: it is what turns the adapter remapping from a rewrite into a refactor.

## Out of Scope

- **Multivariate analysis.** No dynamic time warping across channels, no environmental covariates. The type system and library schema must not preclude it — a future signal becomes multi-channel and spans gain sibling context — but nothing multivariate is built or validated.
- **Data import robustness.** Clean, well-formed time-series input is assumed. No format detection, no malformed-file handling.
- **Open plugin architecture.** The declared interface makes a sixth technique possible; a third-party registry, versioning, or dependency isolation is not built.
- **Drag-and-drop node canvas.** Chains execute from a typed recipe rendered as a staged list. The canvas is a stretch goal only if the freeze date arrives early; the typed registry underneath it is the part that actually makes new techniques easy to add.
- **Rendered PDF reports.** Export is structured JSON plus automatically saved plots.
- **Cross-database exemplar sharing.** A stranger runs an exported template against their own database; shared exemplar identity across databases is not solved.
- **Elastic distances.** Dynamic time warping is available through an existing dependency if it ever becomes affordable, but is not built or evaluated.
- **Wavelet-based band decomposition.** RQ4 uses the existing bandpass filters. Further wavelet methods are backlog, explicitly wanted later.
- **Alternative encoding libraries.** The existing Gramian and recurrence encoders stay; no substitution.
- **Cross-domain corpora.** A non-fungal reference corpus was considered as a control and judged unnecessary.
- **Cache eviction.** No garbage collection of cached artifacts before the freeze; buy disk instead.
- **Automated UI testing.** No browser-driven or screenshot-diff tests.
- **Supported release.** Templates are exportable and re-runnable by a stranger; nothing is documented, packaged, or supported as a product.
- **Biological interpretation.** The software measures recurrence and structure. It makes no claim about meaning, signalling, or communication.

## Further Notes

### How the research questions map onto the build

The software exists to make six questions answerable. Two of them cannot be answered without it; two need it; two are strengthened by it.

| Do cluster-derived labels produce a classifier that generalises better than manually-derived labels? | The typed chain from signal through window set and grouping to a model; the physical human/machine store separation; the held-out lock |
| Does a human-adjudicated exemplar used as a matrix-profile seed recover instances a human also accepts? | Exemplar side-inputs; the native-length match distance; the Review queue; the surrogate control |
| Is motif identity preserved under scale normalisation? | The three distances; the search-at-other-scales action; the distance function recorded on every edge |
| Does band decomposition followed by symbolic encoding surface regions raw-signal methods miss? | Band fan-out scope; the Compare view's set overlap; hand adjudication of the remainder |
| Where do human and analytical judgement diverge, and is the divergence structured? | The union view; adjudication verdicts; annotations with no overlapping detection; morphology tags on both sides |
| Once contamination and propagation are separated out, does recurrence persist across channels and recordings? | Channel fan-out into run groups; cross-channel classification onto edges; surrogate counts |

A negative result on the scale-invariance question falsifies the library's grouping model, which is itself a finding worth reporting.

### Build order

Six milestones over fourteen days to the freeze. Each is a vertical slice that works end to end.

1. **Foundations** — types and serialisers; the verdict-constraint migration; the new tables and union view; remapping the twenty adapters to typed inputs and outputs; chain validation; side-input resolution; the step cache; migrating existing motif rows; the held-out lock. Entirely headless and fully testable.
2. **Review** — the adjudication store and divergence queries; the queue surface; keyboard verdicts with auto-advance and undo; promotion to the library.
3. **Analyse** — the chain builder; the block inspector; scope selection and run groups; the run surface with progress and per-stage results; estimators and cluster routing; generalised job export with array jobs; the manifest writer, reader and import action; the Compare view; folding in run history and the window-matrix panel.
4. **Library** — the three distances; edge computation and persistence; the entry grid and detail; the members overlay and edge list; grouping selectors; search at other scales; cross-channel classification; absorbing the motif browser.
5. **Controls, export, templates** — the surrogate block; paired runs with side-by-side counts; both exporters; template save, apply and carry/rebind.
6. **Freeze and evaluate** — repository cleanup; the end-to-end test; documentation refresh; then unlock the held-out recording and run the full pipeline on it.

**Review is deliberately built before Analyse.** It needs only the first milestone's adjudication table, and thousands of matrix-profile detections are already waiting to be scored. Adjudication throughput is the rate limiter for two research questions, so every day the queue exists earlier is a day of data that cannot be bought back later.

### Guidance for ticket breakdown

Each milestone above decomposes into work packages that are independently workable. Two properties make them safe to run in parallel by separate agents:

- **Module ownership is exclusive.** Within a milestone, no two work packages own the same module. A package that needs a change in another package's module declares that package as a blocker instead.
- **Acceptance is testable without a human.** Every package's acceptance criterion is a statement a test can assert, with the exception of the Panel surfaces, which are explicitly the ones requiring a person to look at them.

**Model routing.** Most packages are well-scoped, have an existing pattern in the repository to copy, and pass or fail on a test — those are suitable for a Sonnet-class model running unattended. Five are not: the four Panel surfaces involving linked views (chain builder, run panel, review queue, library grid) and the verdict-constraint rebuild. The Panel work needs a stronger model *and* a human looking at the output, because a broken dynamic map renders as a silently blank pane rather than an error — a failure mode this codebase has already hit twice. The constraint rebuild needs care because SQLite cannot alter a check constraint in place; it requires the full table-rebuild procedure against roughly eleven thousand rows with a tag join table to preserve. Back up the database first. If it goes badly, the fallback is to record the seed verdict in the existing free-text status column, which needs no rebuild at all.

### Constraints that shaped these decisions

**Time is the dominant constraint.** Fourteen days to freeze, then roughly five weeks to run every experiment and write the thesis. The failure mode to design against is a polished tool with a thin results chapter. Wherever a design choice traded build time against research output, research output won.

**The real bottleneck is review bandwidth, not code generation.** Prior experience on this project: Panel and HoloViews integration bugs — dynamic maps switching element type between frames, range linking, y-range circular dependencies — do not yield to autonomous agent runs, because they require visual inspection to even detect. This is why the design minimises custom linked views: generated parameter UI rather than bespoke controls, a staged list rather than a node canvas, and reuse of the existing plot builders on every new surface.

**The cut list is decided now rather than at two in the morning on the 27th.** In order: drop the step cache and rerun chains instead; drop the template UI and keep JSON import/export; drop the library grouping selectors and ship shape-only grouping; drop the cross-channel classification UI and run it as a script. Never cut: adjudications, surrogate-by-default, and the exporters — those three are what make the results chapter defensible.

### Decision log

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Linear spine with named side-inputs; no fan-out inside a chain | Seeded search and surrogate comparison need extra inputs; a canvas is out of scope and Compare covers the diff case |
| A signal is one channel; multi-channel work is a fan-out, not a type | Keeps univariate typing honest while making sixteen-channel sweeps a single action |
| Extend the existing database; plain SQL, numbered migrations | Data volume is small, bulk arrays already live outside it, and no new dependency reaches the cluster |
| Keep human and machine spans in separate tables; add adjudications and a union view | Physical separation is a stronger one-way door than a discriminator column, and needs no eleven-thousand-row migration |
| One verdict vocabulary across both stores | No translation table exists, so none can drift; the artifact verdict is retained for the contamination question |
| Content-addressed step cache above a small runtime threshold | Makes retuning one stage cheap without spending disk on trivial steps |
| Background thread per run, per-stage results as they land | Single-user application; avoids pickling parameter objects and torch models |
| Preserve the UI-free core | Enables cluster runs, headless tests, and the reproducibility claim |
| Extend the adapter spec rather than migrating to Param | The existing spec already carries recommendation and derived readouts that Param does not |
| Shape-first library identity | Detection-keyed identity cannot express cross-recording membership, persisted edges, or eye-flagged exemplars |
| Seven types on the adapter spec; matrix profile corrected to Scores | Time-alignment is what makes generic thresholding possible |
| Type errors surfaced at composition and enforced at execution, from one function | Two layers, one source of truth |
| Manifest-based cluster round trip | There is no safe merge between two independently auto-incrementing databases |
| Estimator-driven cluster routing | Fan-out multiplies the estimate, so heavy sweeps route themselves |
| Side-inputs hashed by content, not identifier | Local identifiers are not portable; content is |
| Three distances, elastic deferred | Cost, not principle |
| Surrogate on by default, transient, seeded | Default-on is what makes "every result has a null" true in practice |
| Cross-channel classification as a library action, not a block | Keeps multivariate out of the type system and works across runs |
| Four workspaces mirroring the research loop | Nine tabs is a filing cabinet |
| Review built before Analyse | Adjudication throughput is the rate limiter for two research questions |
| Held-out recording enforced in code | Makes the methods claim true by construction |

# Pipeline GUI, Part 2 — The Usability Wave

**Project:** Underground Brains — mycelium bio-electric signal analysis
**Status:** Design settled via grilling, 27 August 2026. Ready for ticket breakdown (T50+).
**Relationship to Part 1:** Part 1 above remains the authority on everything it describes except where a passage carries a **[SUPERSEDED by Part 2]** marker. Part 2 changes *presentation and one schema pair*; it changes no type, no adapter contract, no execution semantics, and no separation between machine detections and human annotations. Where the two disagree, the marker names it and Part 2 wins.

**What changed since Part 1 was written:** T01–T48 are merged. The tool is built and it works. What Part 1 could not know is how it *reads* once assembled, and the freeze is now the point at which the project turns from building the instrument to extracting results with it. Every decision below was taken against that: does this change how much evidence the researcher can get out of the tool in the five weeks after freeze.

---

## Problem Statement

The pipeline is complete and the researcher cannot use it comfortably. Four specific failures, each observed on the assembled application:

**The chain builder does not show a chain.** It renders as a vertical list of step labels above a taller vertical list of twenty "Add …" buttons, seventeen of them enabled and three greyed out with a paragraph of explanation beside them. Nothing about that layout says "these steps happen in order and data flows through them". The composition surface for a pipeline tool does not look like a pipeline, so chains do not get composed — the researcher falls back to running single algorithms, which is the workflow the whole build was meant to replace.

**The analysis is not visible.** The Run algorithm surface shows one plot: the staged span before the run, replaced by the result after. A six-step chain therefore produces one picture. There is no way to see what the detrend did before the SAX ran, or what the SAX produced before the matrix profile consumed it. For a tool whose purpose is understanding what a technique does to a signal, the intermediate states — the part where the understanding actually lives — are not rendered at all.

**Results cannot be told apart.** Runs are identified by autoincrementing integer. The Compare view offers "#12 — recording 49" against "#31 — recording 385" and no way to record that one of them was the tuned lowpass and the other the raw comparison. Its output is a list of interval pairs, which answers "do these two detection sets overlap" but never "what was different about the two chains" — and most comparisons on this project are one-parameter sweeps where that is the only question.

**The library is empty.** `motif_entry`, `motif_member` and `motif_edge` hold zero rows against 34 runs, 703 detections and 11,267 annotations. Three tickets built the grid, the detail view and the grouping selectors; nothing ever populated them. Meanwhile 410 extracted drop motifs across 16 spike trains and 7 channels sit in a derived-data bundle whose generator has been deleted. The library is the stated deliverable of Part 1 and it currently contains nothing.

Two smaller frictions compound these: the run-history sidebar is narrower than its own table, truncating the recipe and parameter columns that make history worth having; and the detections table shows four unlabelled integer columns with no statement of which block produced them or what they are indices into.

## Solution

Make the Analyse workspace show the pipeline, and put the motifs in the library.

**A chain is drawn as a chain.** The builder becomes a horizontal canvas of block cards, left to right, each card carrying the algorithm's name, its input and output types on the edges it connects through, its live parameter controls and derived readouts, and a control that opens that block's plots. A `+` sits between every pair of cards and at the end, so a step can be inserted mid-chain rather than only appended. The picker opened by a `+` lists every block, incompatible ones disabled with the reason — the Part 1 rule, in a place that does not occupy the surface permanently.

**Every stage of the analysis is plotted.** The Run algorithm surface becomes a filmstrip: the chain's input at the top, then one plot per step in order, so the whole transformation reads as a single scroll. Any block can be focused for detail — for the SAX blocks that means the existing signal/PAA/quantised/cutline panels; for the rest it means that step's input and output at full size. Editing a parameter re-runs the suffix from that step onward and nothing before it, automatically when the estimate is cheap and on request when it is not.

**Runs get names, and chains get compared as chains.** A run carries an editable name alongside its id, inherited by its surrogate. The Compare view stacks the two chains as block canvases and highlights what differs between them — a step added, removed, or a parameter changed — above the existing detection-set overlap.

**The library gets populated, and grouped two ways.** The 410 drop motifs are imported from their bundle. Each becomes a library member; shape families are computed across all of them regardless of which spike train they came from; and the spike trains themselves become library entries at a coarser scale, so a train is a thing that can be linked to another train rather than a string on a row. The grid presents both axes — group by provenance to ask "what came out of this recording", group by shape to ask "what recurs across recordings".

**The property that makes the last one worth doing** is already measurable on the seed data. Clustering the pooled 410 motifs yields twelve shape families, eleven of which draw members from more than one spike train — up to eight — and two of which mix morphologies that the per-span labels call distinct. That is cross-recording shape recurrence, which is the thesis claim, sitting in data already on disk and currently invisible because nothing has imported it.

## User Stories

**Composing a chain**

1. As a researcher, I want to see my chain drawn left to right as connected blocks, so that I can read the order data flows in without reconstructing it from a list.
2. As a researcher, I want each block to show its input type on the left and output type on the right, so that I can see why two blocks connect before I try to connect them.
3. As a researcher, I want a `+` between every pair of blocks, so that I can insert a preprocessing step in the middle of a chain without deleting and rebuilding everything after it.
4. As a researcher, I want the block picker to list every registered algorithm with incompatible ones disabled and the reason shown, so that I learn the type system by being told why rather than by noticing something is missing.
5. As a researcher, I want a block's parameters editable on its own card, so that I do not have to move to a separate surface and re-select the step I am already looking at.
6. As a researcher, I want the derived readouts (symbols produced, window count) live on the card as I type, so that I can picture the effect of a parameter I cannot otherwise picture.
7. As a researcher, I want to reorder and delete blocks on the canvas, so that editing a chain is direct manipulation rather than form-filling.
8. As a researcher, I want a chain I reopened from history to appear on the canvas exactly as it ran, so that "re-run or tweak it" starts from a picture rather than a description.
9. As a researcher, I want an invalid chain to say which junction is wrong, so that I fix the connection rather than guessing which step to remove.

**Seeing the analysis**

10. As a researcher, I want every step of my chain plotted in order on one surface, so that I can see what each technique did to the signal rather than only what came out of the last one.
11. As a researcher, I want the chain's input plotted at the top of that filmstrip, so that every transformation is read against the thing it transformed.
12. As a researcher, I want each plot labelled with the block that produced it and the type it is, so that a strip of six plots is navigable rather than a wall of curves.
13. As a researcher, I want to focus a single block and see it larger, so that I can inspect a step closely without losing the chain around it.
14. As a researcher, I want a focused SAX block to show its signal, PAA, quantised and cutline panels, so that I can see the encoding decision itself rather than only its output symbols.
15. As a researcher, I want a block whose output is not a signal — a grouping, a model, a score series — to still render as something, so that half my chain is not blank panes.
16. As a researcher, I want editing a parameter to re-run only that step and the ones after it, so that retuning the last step of a chain containing a matrix profile does not cost hours.
17. As a researcher, I want an expensive re-run to ask before it starts and tell me the estimate, so that I do not lose an afternoon to a keystroke.
18. As a researcher, I want a cheap re-run to just happen, so that tuning a filter feels immediate.
19. As a researcher, I want stale plots marked as stale while a re-run is in flight, so that I never read an old picture as a new result.
20. As a researcher, I want to run a single algorithm as easily as before, so that the new composition surface does not tax the simplest case.

**Telling runs apart**

21. As a researcher, I want to give a run a name I choose, so that I can find it again without memorising integers.
22. As a researcher, I want a run's name shown everywhere its id is shown — history, compare, exports, block headers — so that the name is the identifier in practice and not decoration.
23. As a researcher, I want a surrogate run to inherit its parent's name, so that a paired run does not appear as an anonymous stranger beside a named one.
24. As a researcher, I want to rename a run after the fact, so that I can label it once I know what it showed.
25. As a researcher, I want the Compare view to draw both chains as block canvases, so that I compare methods rather than integers.
26. As a researcher, I want the differing steps and parameters highlighted between those two chains, so that a one-parameter sweep is legible at a glance.
27. As a researcher, I want a one-line summary of the difference, so that I can paste it into notes without transcribing a diagram.
28. As a researcher, I want the existing detection-set overlap kept below the chain comparison, so that I get both "what was different" and "what did it change".

**Working the history sidebar**

29. As a researcher, I want to collapse the run-history sidebar to a ribbon, so that the chain canvas gets the full width when I am composing.
30. As a researcher, I want to expand it to a width that fits its table, so that the recipe and parameter columns are readable when I am searching history.
31. As a researcher, I want the sidebar collapsed by default while I am on the chain builder, so that the two surfaces do not fight over the same pixels.
32. As a researcher, I want the status filter wide enough to show its selections, so that I can tell what I have filtered to.

**Understanding the detections table**

33. As a researcher, I want the detections table to name the block whose spans it is showing, so that I know which step of a six-step chain produced them.
34. As a researcher, I want it stated that the indices are samples into the whole recording, so that I do not misread them as offsets into the staged span.
35. As a researcher, I want it stated that these are machine detections and that verdicts go in Review, so that the separation is visible at the point of confusion rather than only in the schema.

**Populating the library**

36. As a researcher, I want my 410 extracted drop motifs imported into the library, so that the library page shows my actual work instead of an empty grid.
37. As a researcher, I want each motif to keep its provenance — the spike train, recording, channel and sample range it came from — so that a card can always be traced back to the signal.
38. As a researcher, I want motifs grouped into shape families computed across every spike train, so that I can find shapes that recur in places I did not look for them.
39. As a researcher, I want a spike train to be a library entry in its own right, so that I can later ask which trains resemble each other rather than only which spikes do.
40. As a researcher, I want to re-run the clustering at a different threshold without re-importing, so that I can tune the number of families after seeing the first attempt.
41. As a researcher, I want re-clustering to preserve any tag or exemplar I set by hand, so that exploring thresholds does not destroy my judgements.
42. As a researcher, I want to see which clustering a view is showing, so that two different threshold choices are never confused for one result.
43. As a researcher, I want the import to be safe to run twice, so that a mistake costs nothing.

**Reading the library**

44. As a researcher, I want the grid grouped by shape family or by spike train at my choice, so that I can ask both "what recurs" and "what did this recording produce".
45. As a researcher, I want a family that spans several recordings marked as such, so that the cross-recording result is visible rather than something I have to compute.
46. As a researcher, I want thumbnails drawn in millivolts without amplitude normalisation, so that the scaling evidence survives the surface I look at most.
47. As a researcher, I want a shared y-scale within a family, so that relative depth between members is real rather than an artifact of per-card autoscaling.
48. As a researcher, I want to filter by morphology, purity, spike train, recording and channel, so that I can narrow 410 cards to the ones in question.
49. As a researcher, I want to filter by depth and duration range, so that I can isolate an amplitude regime.
50. As a researcher, I want to sort a family by distance from its exemplar, so that I can see the cleanest and the most marginal members immediately.
51. As a researcher, I want to distinguish single-spike entries from spike-train entries, so that the two scales do not intermix in one undifferentiated grid.

**Seeing the whole motif**

52. As a researcher, I want the overlaid-motifs plot to show every sample of every curve by default, so that the depth of a drop — the thing that carries the evidence — is not clipped off the top of the frame.
53. As a researcher, I want the old bounded view available as an option, so that one deep transient flattening the others is still a view I can reach.

## Implementation Decisions

### Chain shape, revised

The chain remains a **linear spine with named side-inputs** exactly as Part 1 specifies. No fan-out, no merges, no general node graph. What changes is the presentation: a horizontal canvas of fixed-width cards rather than a vertical list of labels. The canvas scrolls horizontally rather than wrapping, because wrapping destroys the left-to-right reading that is the entire reason for the change.

`ChainState` is **not modified**. It already carries steps, ordering, parameters, side-input bindings and its available-blocks query, and its add-step operation already accepts an insertion index — mid-chain insertion is a presentation capability that the model has always had and no surface has ever offered. The canvas is a renderer of the existing model. A ticket that finds itself changing the chain model in order to draw a canvas has misread the seam.

Type compatibility continues to come from the single chain-validation function, consumed at composition and at execution. The `+` picker shows every block with incompatible ones disabled and the reason inline; the reason text is the same text, relocated.

### The Analyse workspace, revised

The workspace holds the same jobs; which surface does which changes.

- **Chain builder** becomes the primary surface and gains the block canvas.
- **Block inspector ceases to exist.** Its whole content — generated parameter controls, recommended defaults, live derived readouts, side-input pickers, cached-result display — moves onto the block card. It was a third surface editing the same model as two others, which is why none of the three read as authoritative. Its parameter-widget and derived-readout code is already shared with the run panel, so this is relocation, not reimplementation.
- **Run algorithm** becomes the filmstrip plus focus mode. Its stage and algorithm selectors move onto the card; running one algorithm becomes composing a one-block chain. The staged-span basket and span selector stay, because they are chain-wide rather than per-block.
- **Compare** gains the two stacked chain canvases and the diff above its existing overlap output.
- **Run history** stays a sidebar and becomes collapsible.

### Rendering by interchange type

One new function is the single entry point for turning a value into a plot: given an interchange type, a value and the adapter's metadata, return a renderable element. Seven types, seven renderers. `Signal` is a curve; `Encoding` a symbol strip; `Scores` a series against time; `SpanSet` an interval overlay; `WindowSet` a window index; `Grouping` a cluster-size summary; `Model` a text card, because a trained model has no natural plot and pretending otherwise produces a decorative lie.

Every plot-centric surface — filmstrip, focus mode, block card preview — goes through this one function. Nothing renders a value by switching on its type locally. This is the decision that keeps "plot-centric" from degrading into "blank for half the blocks", which is the silently-blank-pane failure mode this codebase has hit twice.

A **second, optional layer** handles per-adapter richness: the adapter spec gains an optional detail-view hook, used by focus mode when present and falling back to the type renderer when absent. This is the established extension pattern on that spec, which already carries optional hooks for plotting, estimation, recommendation, derived readouts and persistence. Only the SAX blocks will declare one initially; every other block shows the type renderer in focus mode, and that is the expected end state for this wave, not a shortfall.

### Filmstrip content and recomputation

What the filmstrip shows is decided **headlessly**, not inside Panel callbacks: a function on the chain model returns the ordered list of what to render — per step, its label, its input and output types, and whether its cached result is current. The surface renders that list. This is what makes the plot-centric feature testable without a browser.

Recomputation is **suffix-only**. The step cache is keyed on a recipe-prefix hash, so editing step N invalidates N and everything after it while leaving everything before it cached. A function derives that suffix from the recipe and the changed index. The naive alternative — re-run the chain — is the difference between instant and hours on any chain containing a matrix profile, so the rule is stated here rather than left to an implementer's judgement.

The suffix runs automatically when its summed estimate is below the interactive budget already defined for run routing, and asks first when it is above. This reuses the existing estimator and routing threshold; it does not introduce a second cost model.

### Run naming

The runs table gains a nullable name column, applied through the existing additive column migration. The name is editable in the history table and displayed anywhere the run id is displayed. A paired surrogate run inherits its parent's name with a surrogate suffix — Part 1 makes surrogate pairing default-on, so every launch produces two runs and naming only one of them would read as a defect.

The name is a label, never an identifier. Nothing keys on it, nothing enforces uniqueness, and the recipe hash remains the identity of a run's content.

### Chain comparison

A function takes two recipes and returns their per-step difference — steps present in one and not the other, and parameters whose values differ. Pure, headless, and placed beside the existing run-set comparison so the Compare surface has one module to talk to rather than two.

### Library entries at two scales

The motif-entry table gains a **scale** column distinguishing an event-scale entry (one spike) from a train-scale entry (a spike train). This is the one schema addition that is not presentational, and it is what makes the stated end-goal reachable: linking trains to each other by symbolic or spectral similarity requires a train to be a row that an edge can attach to. The edge table already carries distance function, threshold and recipe hash, so train-to-train edges under a different distance coexist with event-to-event edges without further schema change.

Grouping has **two independent axes** and they are not conflated:

- **Provenance** is the spike train a motif came from. It is already exact in the seed data and requires no computation.
- **Shape** is computed across all motifs regardless of origin, by the existing clustering module — Ward linkage on resampled, z-normalised vectors under the scale-invariant distance, with roughness kept as a separate quality filter rather than folded into the distance.

They answer different questions, and the finding is only visible when both exist and can be seen to disagree.

### Library import

A headless importer reads the seed bundle and writes library rows. It reuses the existing drop-motif store reader and clustering module unchanged — verified against the real bundle: 410 events, 410 snippet triples, keys aligned, twelve shape families at a cophenetic correlation of 0.63, eleven of them spanning multiple spike trains.

The importer is **idempotent and re-clusterable**. Members are keyed on their content — recording, start and end sample — and are never duplicated on a second run. Entries and edges for a given distance-function-and-threshold pair are replaced wholesale, so re-clustering at a new threshold regroups without re-ingesting and without destroying manual tags or hand-set exemplars added between runs. Which clustering is being viewed becomes a visible selector on the Library grid, because two threshold choices that look alike and are not is the failure this guards against.

### Rendering rule for motif waveforms

Clustering z-normalises so that "same shape" has a definition. **Figures do not.** Thumbnails and overlays draw detrended millivolts, unnormalised, with a shared y-scale within a family so relative depth is real. This is not a style preference: the project's own submission language is that normalisation of amplitude destroys the evidence of scaling laws for depolarisation events. It is stated here so that no later ticket "improves" the cards by normalising them.

### Overlay y-range

The motif waveform overlay takes a y-range mode: fit-to-data by default, with the previous inter-quartile fence available as an option. *(Already implemented ahead of this wave.)* The fence was correct for the problem it solved — one deep drop rendering every other curve flat — but its consequence is that the transient draws clipped at the frame edge, and for a drop motif the transient is the evidence. Both modes are kept because both are legitimate; only the default changes.

### Seed data custody

The seed bundle is tracked in version control rather than left in ignored derived-data output, because its generator was deleted and it cannot be regenerated. *(Already done ahead of this wave.)* Its two data files were renamed to the store reader's filename contract so the importer needs no filename parameterisation.

## Testing Decisions

**What makes a good test here.** A test asserts externally observable behaviour: what a function returns, what a row contains, what panes a surface constructs. It does not assert that a particular helper was called or that state has a particular internal shape. Panel surfaces are the special case this repository has learned the hard way — a broken dynamic map renders as a *silently blank pane*, not an error, so every surface ticket's acceptance includes a headless construction test asserting the expected panes exist with non-`None` objects. That has been the pattern since the run panel, the motif browser and the ribbon panes, and it is the reason those three exist as separate test modules.

**Seams under test.** Four new headless functions carry the behavioural weight of this wave, and each is a pure function testable with no browser and no database:

- **Value rendering by type** — called directly with a value of each of the seven interchange types; asserts an element of the expected kind comes back and is non-empty. Prior art: the encoding-panel and overlay-density tests.
- **Filmstrip plan** — called on a chain model; asserts the ordered per-step render list, its types, and its cache states. Prior art: the chain-state tests.
- **Suffix recomputation** — called with a recipe and a changed step index; asserts exactly the suffix is returned and the prefix is not. Prior art: the step-cache tests.
- **Recipe diff** — called with two recipes; asserts added, removed and changed-parameter records. Prior art: the compare tests.

**Existing seams reused rather than added to.** The chain model, the chain-validation function, the motif entry/member/edge writers, the additive column migration, the drop-motif store reader and the clustering module are all consumed unchanged. No new UI seam is introduced: every surface already exposes a layout method and is verified by headless construction.

**Schema tests.** Both new columns are verified the way the existing additive migrations are — initialise a database twice and assert the column exists once, that a database created before the migration gains it, and that the migration is a no-op when already current.

**Importer tests.** Run the importer against a small fixture bundle; assert member count, that provenance survives onto each row, that a second run creates no duplicates, and that re-clustering at a different threshold replaces edges while preserving a manually applied tag. Prior art: the manifest-import tests, which cover the same shape of problem — read an external bundle, reconstruct rows, do not duplicate.

**What is not tested automatically.** Whether the canvas *reads* as a pipeline, whether the filmstrip is legible, and whether the collapsed sidebar is discoverable are human judgements. Every ticket touching those carries the human-verify flag, exactly as the Part 1 Panel-surface tickets did.

## Out of Scope

- **SAX grouping of individual spikes.** A hundred-sample spike has no obvious alphabet size or word length, and choosing them badly produces groups that look meaningful and are not. It gets its own ticket after the shape families have been looked at, informed by them.
- **Linking spike trains to each other.** The scale column makes it possible; computing train-to-train edges by spectral or symbolic distance is later work.
- **A general node canvas.** The chain is a linear spine. Part 1's reasoning stands: fan-out is a scope concern and chain comparison is the Compare view's job.
- **Recovering the drop-motif generator.** Its sources survive on the unmerged branch `feat/drop-motifs-five-stage`; merging or re-homing them is separate work with no bearing on this wave, which consumes the bundle rather than regenerating it.
- **Regenerating the seed figures.** The rendered plots remain where they are; nothing in this wave reads them.
- **Any change to the type system, the adapter contract, execution semantics, the surrogate protocol, or the detection/annotation separation.** This wave is presentation plus two nullable columns.
- **The held-out recording.** Still locked, still unlocked only by the freeze-day ticket.

## Further Notes

### Build order

The library importer goes **first**, ahead of the chain-builder work, despite the chain builder being the higher-value change. It is small, it depends on nothing else in this wave, and until it runs the Library grid has no content — which means every downstream library ticket has nothing to be verified against. A grid ticket whose acceptance is checked against an empty grid has not been checked.

After that: value rendering by type, then the canvas, then the filmstrip and focus mode, then naming and compare, then the library grid work, then the sidebar accordion.

### Guidance for ticket breakdown

**Prefer many small tickets to few large ones.** A ticket sized to one red-green-refactor cycle with a single testable acceptance criterion is implemented correctly far more often than one carrying four. The filmstrip work in particular should not be one ticket: the headless plan function, the filmstrip rendering, the focus-mode detail hook, and the removal of the block inspector are four separate cycles with four separate acceptance criteria.

**Value rendering by type blocks everything plot-centric.** It is the prerequisite for the canvas cards, the filmstrip and focus mode. It should land before any of them and should not be merged into any of them.

**Module ownership stays exclusive**, as in Part 1. The chain model, the plotting module and the database layer will each be wanted by more than one ticket in this wave; those pairs are mutexes.

**Model routing.** The canvas, the filmstrip and the library grid are linked-view Panel work and need both a stronger model and human eyes, for the reason Part 1 gives. The importer, the two schema columns, the recipe diff and the suffix function are headless, pass or fail on a test, and are suitable for unattended runs.

### Cut list

Decided now rather than under pressure. In order: **drop the sidebar accordion** and leave the sidebar as it is; **drop focus mode** and ship the filmstrip alone; **drop the chain diff highlighting** and ship the two canvases unstyled with the summary line. Cutting should mean not starting a ticket, never unpicking one.

**Never cut:** the library import, and value rendering by type. The first is the only thing standing between the stated deliverable and an empty table. The second is what stops the plot-centric surfaces being blank.

### Decision log

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Horizontal block canvas, linear spine unchanged | The chain was always a spine; only its drawing was wrong. A canvas that draws a spine costs a renderer, not a model |
| The chain model is untouched | It already supports insertion, reordering and compatibility; the missing capability was presentational |
| Block inspector absorbed into the card and deleted | Three surfaces editing one model is why none of them read as authoritative |
| Single-algorithm run becomes a one-block chain | Two ways to do one thing is the ambiguity being removed; keeping both would preserve it |
| One render-by-type function, seven renderers | Local type switches are how half a filmstrip ends up blank |
| Optional per-adapter detail hook rather than a richer type renderer | Encoding internals are per-adapter knowledge; the spec already carries five optional hooks |
| Filmstrip content decided headlessly | A surface whose content is decided in Panel callbacks is only testable by eye, and blank panes do not raise |
| Suffix-only recomputation | On a chain containing a matrix profile this is the difference between instant and hours |
| Reuse the existing estimate and routing threshold | A second cost model would drift from the first |
| Run name is a label, never an identifier | Nothing keys on it; recipe hash remains identity |
| Surrogate inherits its parent's name | Pairing is default-on, so anonymous partners would look like a defect |
| A scale column rather than inferring scale from duration | Linking trains needs a row for an edge to attach to; inference gives no such row |
| Provenance and shape kept as separate grouping axes | They answer different questions, and the finding is that they disagree |
| Importer idempotent, entries and edges replaced per threshold | Threshold tuning is expected; destroying manual tags on every attempt is not |
| Figures unnormalised in millivolts | Amplitude normalisation destroys the scaling-law evidence the thesis claims |
| Overlay y-range defaults to fit-to-data | The transient is the evidence; the fence clipped exactly it |
| Seed bundle tracked in version control | It was deleted from `main` and survives only on an unmerged branch; the wave should not depend on that branch outliving it |
| Library import scheduled before the chain builder | An empty grid cannot verify a grid ticket |
