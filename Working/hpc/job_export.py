job_export.py
===============
Headless HPC job generation for matrix-profile runs
(MATRIX_PROFILE_UI_PROMPT.md §5). Generates a recipe JSON in exactly the
shape `Pipelines/run_recipe/run_recipe.py` reads, plus an `sbatch` script
that invokes it — no SSH, no submission from here. `Working/` must not
import Panel; this module doesn't either.

`export_mp_job` deliberately goes through `run_recipe.py`, not
`Pipelines/matrix_profile/run_matrix_profile.py` directly — the latter has
`CH`/`FILE`/`WINDOW_MIN` as module-level constants that would need editing
per job (exactly what `HPC/README.md` says not to do). Going through
`run_recipe.py` also means the cluster run registers its own
`runs`/`artifacts` rows via `detection.matrix_profile`'s `persist` hook,
so a returned `.npz` slots into the browser with no separate import step.

Two things this module does NOT resolve on its own:

1. **`--chdir`.** `HPC/README.md` records that hand-written job scripts
   disagree (`/home/s4699158/CNN` in `score_job.sh` vs
   `/home/Student/s4699158/CNN` in `wm_job.sh`/`mp_job.sh`). Generated
   scripts use `Working.config.HPC_REMOTE_REPO_ROOT` — confirm that value
   is actually correct for your account before submitting anything it
   produces.
2. **Getting the files to the cluster.** This only writes into the local
   working tree (`HPC/Detection/generated/` by default). The generated
   `.sh`/`.json` pair still needs to reach rangpur the same way the
   hand-written scripts do (git sync, scp, ...) before `sbatch` can run it.
3. **Partition names.** `HPC_CPU_PARTITION`/`HPC_GPU_PARTITION`
   (`Working/config.py`) are this account's real partition names as of
   2026-08-31 (`sinfo`/`scontrol show partition`) — a reconfiguration
   (rangpur's login banner warns these do happen) could rename or remove
   them again. If `sbatch` ever says `invalid partition specified`, re-run
   `sinfo -o "%P %a %l %D %G %f"` before guessing a replacement string —
   two rounds of guessing (`gpu`, then `--partition=gpu` without `--gres`)
   both failed against the live account before the real names were pulled
   from `sinfo` directly.

#
#  - the chain resubmits itself, as `HPC/Preprocessing/wm_job.sh` does;
#  - it resubmits on `wm_status.py`'s EXIT CODE, not by grepping a status
#    string — the grep is what turned one stuck window into an infinite
#    chain (WINDOW_MATRIX_UI_PROMPT.md §0.2);
#  - there is a hard cap on chain length, so even a bug that always reports
#    incomplete terminates;
#  - resuming jobs pass `--force`, because `execute_recipe` short-circuits
#    on a completed run for the same recipe and span and would otherwise
#    "reuse" the partial matrix instead of continuing it;
#  - `--gres=gpu:a100` (and `HPC_GPU_PARTITION`) only when a CNN stage is
#    enabled; a Catch22 + entropy build is CPU-only and requests
#    `HPC_CPU_PARTITION` instead, with no `--gres` at all -- it should not
#    queue for a GPU node, both because it doesn't need one and because
#    the account's GPU partitions are small and department-shared
#    (`a100-test`: 2 nodes, 2 total A100s) next to the CPU partitions
#    (`Working/config.py`, informed by `sinfo`/`scontrol show partition`
#    on the real account, 2026-08-31).
#  - NO `--mem=` line at all. `16G` (a100-test-sized), then `4G` (a
#    measurement-informed reduction) were both rejected outright with
#    "Memory specification can not be satisfied" on `HPC_CPU_PARTITION`

    """Generate a recipe JSON + resubmitting `sbatch` script for a
    `preprocessing.window_matrix` run of `window_min` minutes over
    `recording_id` (`span=None` means the whole channel).

    `fan_out` is an optional `{"kind": "channels"|"bands", "targets": [...]}`
    scope; when present the recipe is exported as a SINGLE SLURM array job
    whose task index selects its target from the baked-in list. NOTE: the
    chain script's `wm_status --artifact` path is derived from the BASE
    recording, so a multi-target fan-out should be verified against each
    target's actual artifact path before submission.

    Named by config hash, so re-exporting the exact same job overwrites its
    own prior export rather than accumulating a new pair every time.

    `timeout_s` defaults to the SLURM wall clock minus a cleanup margin, so
    the builder saves a resumable partial artifact BEFORE SLURM kills the
    job. `wm_job.sh` gets this relationship right by hand today
    (`--time=00:20:00` against `--timeout 19`); deriving it here means it
    cannot drift.

    Returns `{"script_path", "recipe_path", "artifact_path", "sbatch_command",
    "job_name", "slurm_time", "timeout_s"}`. All paths are local/relative —
    see the module docstring for what still has to happen before
    `sbatch_command` can run anywhere.
