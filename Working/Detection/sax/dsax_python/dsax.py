# dSAX (delta-SAX): a trend-symbolic representation.
#
# dSAX segments a series EXACTLY as PAA does, but encodes each segment by
# how much it rose or fell across the segment rather than by its mean,
# into an ordered alphabet whose middle symbol means "no meaningful
# change". For the default 3-symbol alphabet: 0 = DOWN, 1 = SAME, 2 = UP,
# 0-based and ascending, so `np.searchsorted(cutlines, delta, side="right")`
# produces the symbol directly — the same convention as csax/psax.
#
# ── This is not a novel method. What it reuses, and what differs ─────────
#
# Trend-symbolic time-series representations are a well-established family.

#       Per-segment U/D/S trend symbols concatenated with SAX value
#       symbols. This is the closest antecedent to dSAX's alphabet — dSAX
#       is TVA's trend channel taken alone.

#       dSAX reuses pSAX's Epanechnikov KDE + k-means++ + Lloyd-Max
#       machinery UNCHANGED (imported, not copied), applied to the DELTA
#       distribution instead of the PAA distribution.
#
# The contribution claimed here is narrow and should not be overstated
# anywhere: applying a data-adaptively quantised, ZERO-ANCHORED trend
# alphabet to fungal bio-electric recordings, so that a shared morphology
# vocabulary (sharkfin, rollinghill, ...) becomes regex-searchable over the
# symbol string. Nothing more.
#
# ── Why Lloyd-Max and not cSAX's Mean-Shift ──────────────────────────────
#
# cSAX learns its cutlines by Mean-Shift clustering the PAA and cutting
# midway between cluster centres. That works when the level distribution is
# multi-modal (two resting potentials, say). The DELTA distribution of a
# roughly stationary signal is not: it is one unimodal lump centred near
# zero. Mean-Shift would routinely return a single cluster, and cSAX's
# `while clust_cent.shape[1] < 2` loop would exhaust its multi_factor
# halving and take the fallback path — silently producing classic 10-symbol
# Gaussian SAX, which is not a trend encoding at all. Lloyd-Max has no such
# failure mode: it always yields exactly `alphabet_size` codewords, however
# unimodal the density. So `learned` mode is pSAX's machinery, deliberately,
# and Mean-Shift is not offered.
#
# ── Why dSAX does not call timeseries2symbol ─────────────────────────────
#
# csax/psax normalise TWICE — once here, then again inside
# `timeseries2symbol`'s single-window path — and their `details` code has to
# compose both affine transforms to report honest raw-unit values.
# dSAX computes its deltas and quantises them itself with one
# `np.searchsorted`, so there is exactly ONE normalisation step and no
# composition to get wrong. Do not "restore" the double-normalisation dance
# by routing dSAX through `timeseries2symbol`: it quantises segment MEANS,
# which is the wrong quantity.
#
# ── The delta conversion rule, which is NOT the PAA conversion rule ──────
#
# A delta is a DIFFERENCE, so an additive offset cancels out of it. If the
# normalisation was `x_norm = (x - mu) / sigma`, then:
#
#     delta_raw = delta_norm * sigma            # scale ONLY — no + mu
#     paa_raw   = paa_norm   * sigma + mu       # offset applies to LEVELS
#
# Getting this wrong produces deltas offset by the recording's DC level,
# which on a fungal electrode (tens of mV of standing potential against
# sub-mV excursions) is a factor-of-100 error that still looks plausible.
# `details["delta_scale"]` is the sigma-only constant and is the ONLY thing
# any delta-domain -> raw conversion may use, cutlines included.
# `tests/test_dsax.py` asserts the mean does not appear.

    not — zero means "no change", and it is the only value in the whole

    Lloyd-Max minimises squared error against the observed density and has
    no reason whatsoever to respect that origin; on a signal with a faint
    net drift it will happily shift the whole codebook off zero, so
    "SAME" would come to mean "rising at the average rate", and the

    Folding fixes that with no extra parameter and no extra assumption:
      - it is idempotent (folding an already-symmetric set changes nothing);
      - it preserves ascent, because `c_j` ascends and `-c_{m-1-j}` ascends;

    Determinism
    -----------
    `threshold_mode="learned"` initialises Lloyd-Max with `kmeanspp`, whose
    draws come from a LOCAL generator seeded by `random_state` — by default
    the fixed `KMEANSPP_SEED`, so the same input always gives the same
    cutlines and string, and the global `np.random` is neither consumed nor
    reseeded (fixup-dsax-seed; before it, the global generator was used and
    one recipe gave different spans run to run). Pass another seed to sweep
    the initialisation from a script; the adapter deliberately does not
    expose it, so no recipe hash depends on it. `"absolute"` and
    `"quantile"` touch no RNG at all.

    `cutlines_degenerate` is one flag covering three distinct situations

    only information a reader can act on: a constant channel is a data
    problem, a straight ramp is a preprocessing problem, and nudged
    cutlines are a quantiser problem.

    Discriminated by observable facts rather than by re-deriving the
    encoder's internal tolerances, so this can never disagree with the
    flag it is explaining:
      - all symbols in the zero bin  -> the deltas were all zero;
      - otherwise no spread in the deltas -> a perfectly straight ramp;
      - otherwise -> two cutlines collided and were forced apart.

    """dSAX's own four-panel figure. NOT `plot_encoding_matplotlib`.

    The shared SAX renderer draws `cutlines_raw` as horizontal amplitude
    bands behind `paa_raw`. dSAX's cutlines are thresholds on a RISE, in
    units of amplitude-per-segment, and its `paa_raw` is a level. Drawing
    one against the other would produce a figure that is not merely
    unhelpful but physically meaningless — two quantities of different
    dimension sharing an axis, with the bands appearing to explain symbols
    they had no part in choosing. Hence a separate renderer, and hence the
    matching warning in `_sax_common`'s docstring is echoed here.

    The four panels answer four different questions:
      1. did the fitted trend actually track the signal?
      2. what were the per-segment deltas, and where did the cutlines fall?
      3. is the threshold SENSIBLE — i.e. does the SAME band sit over the
         bulk of the delta distribution or slice through it? This is the
         panel worth looking at first.
      4. what string came out?

    `Agg` is forced before pyplot is imported: this must render inside a
    SLURM job with no display, and matplotlib picks its backend at first
    pyplot import, so setting it afterwards is too late.
