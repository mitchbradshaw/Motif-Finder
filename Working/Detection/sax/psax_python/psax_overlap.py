    """
    pSAX symbolic representation with overlapping sliding windows.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data          : array-like — full time series
    training_len  : int        — samples used for training
    win_size      : int        — sliding window length
    paa_size      : int        — PAA segments per window
    alphabet_size : int        — quantiser codebook size
    normalize     : bool       — z-normalise each subsequence independently
    random_state  : int, Generator, RandomState or None — source of
                    k-means++'s initialisation draws; defaults to the fixed
                    `KMEANSPP_SEED`, so the same input always gives the same
                    string. Never touches global `np.random` (see `kmeanspp`)

    Returns
    -------
    str_out : np.ndarray, shape (num_windows, paa_size)
                  pSAX symbol matrix (0-based), one row per window.
