    """
    cSAX symbolic representation (non-overlapping windows).

    Parameters
    ----------
    data         : array-like — full time series
    training_len : int        — number of samples used for density estimation
    dim_ratio    : float      — dimensionality reduction ratio (e.g. 1/3 → every 3 samples → 1 symbol)
    normalize    : bool       — z-normalise the dataset as a whole before processing
    return_details : bool     — if True, return `(str_out, details)` instead of
        just `str_out` (default False: byte-identical to every existing caller).
        See the module-level note below for what `details` contains and why.
    random_state : int, Generator, RandomState or None — the source of
        Mean-Shift's seed-point draws. Defaults to the fixed `KMEANSPP_SEED`
        (fixup-csax-seed): the original drew from the global `np.random`, so
        one recipe gave different strings run to run. One generator is built
        here and shared by both Mean-Shift passes below. Not a recipe
        parameter; never touches global `np.random`.

    Returns
    -------
    str_out : np.ndarray, shape (data_nseg,) — cSAX symbolic sequence (0-based symbol indices)
    details : dict, only when return_details=True — see below.

    Notes on `return_details` (2026-08, UI encoding-inspection view)
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    `timeseries2symbol` is called here with `N=data_len` — a single window
    spanning the entire (already once-normalised) `data` — so internally it
    re-derives `mu, sigma = sub.mean(), sub.std()` on that single window and
    normalises AGAIN before computing the PAA it actually quantises
    (`_map_to_string`). That second, internal normalisation is a real,
    distinct affine transform (not a no-op — the once-normalised data's mean
    isn't exactly 0 nor its std exactly 1 after trimming), so the PAA that
    determined every symbol is NOT exactly `training_paa` above (which is
    only used to learn the cutlines, from the training set's PAA under the
    FIRST normalisation only). `details["paa"]` replicates that inner
    normalisation explicitly, matching `timeseries2symbol`'s single-window
    path exactly, so it is provably the same array `_map_to_string` used —
    verified in tests/test_sax_details.py by re-quantising it against
    `details["cutlines"]` by hand and reproducing `str_out` exactly.
    `details["norm_mean"]`/`["norm_std"]` are the COMPOSED constants of both
    normalisation steps, so `raw = value * norm_std + norm_mean` undoes the
    full chain in one step for `paa`/`cutlines` alike.
