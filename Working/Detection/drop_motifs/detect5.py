detect5.py
===========
Five-stage spike-drop detection: fast-down / down / same / up / fast-up.

An EXTENSION of `detect.py`, not a replacement. That module keeps working
unchanged, keeps its presets and keeps reproducing the figures already in
`Plots/drop_motifs/`; nothing here is imported by it. The three helpers
this module reuses (`detrend`, `slope_noise_sigma`, `find_trough`, ...)
are imported from it rather than reimplemented, so a fix to the noise
estimator or the knee rule lands in both detectors at once.

The three things this module changes
------------------------------------

1. THE WINDOW, which is the defect this was written for.

   `detect.py` sizes a snippet as multiples of the fall's own duration -
   two before the onset, four after the trough. That is scale-free, which
   is why it was chosen, but on a PERIODIC train it is unbounded in the
   only unit that matters. At a 236 s fall the window is 1416 s wide; the
   sharkfin period there is ~510 s; so the window holds three spikes and
   the per-cluster overlay drew a train instead of an event. The figure
   was wrong and nothing raised.

   Here the window is bracketed on the surrounding UP RUNS, which cannot
   overrun a neighbour because the neighbour's rise IS the boundary. The
   rule is one rule read forwards and backwards:

                       sharkfin (rise->fall)      trough (fall->rise)
       anchor          initial drop onset         initial drop onset
       left edge       START of preceding UP      END of previous UP
       right edge      START of next UP           END of first UP after

   The trough row is not a special case, it is the reflection. It has to
   be: a trough spike's RECOVERY is an UP run and is part of the motif, so
   a naive "stop at the next UP run" would end the window at the bottom of
   the trough and discard the right half of every event. The fall-multiple
   rule survives only as a CAP (`window_cap_mult`), for an isolated event
   with no bounding rise to stop at.

2. THE ALPHABET. Five stages, with the outer two pinned to the noise floor.

   dSAX already ships a five-symbol alphabet (`d D S U u`, outer bins
   lower case). It is not used directly, for a reason found in its source:
   `_quantile_cutlines` HONOURS `same_fraction` only at k=3 and falls back
   to equiprobable bins above it, so `dsax(alphabet_size=5)` would quietly
   deliver a 20% SAME band instead of the tuned value and the extension
   would not be an extension - it would be a different encoding wearing
   the same parameter names.

   So the encoding is built as a genuine refinement of the three-stage
   one: dSAX runs at k=3 exactly as `detect.py` runs it, which fixes the
   SAME band at `same_fraction` and makes the three-stage reading
   recoverable by folding case (`d|D -> D`, `u|U -> U`). The D and U bands
   are then SPLIT by the MAD noise floor, so `d` means "at least
   `slope_sigma` sigmas of noise steeper than nothing" - a physical claim,
   and the same threshold that gates a drop.

   That last point is the payoff: `d` in the string and "this candidate
   passed the slope gate" become the same statement, so the alphabet stops
   being decorative and becomes the detector's own record of its decision.
   An occupancy quantile could not do this - decision 2.7 of the shipped
   detector already measured such a cutline at three orders of magnitude
   below a real drop's slope.

3. TWO TRIGGERS, one morphology per span.

   `detect.py` finds a rise and scans forward for a fall, so a drop with
   no rise before it is invisible - which is most of catalogue ID 25 and
   all of Mushroom's icicles. Here a bare `d` also triggers. Where both
   fire on the same fall the RISE wins (it is strictly more evidence) and
   the suppression is counted, which is what makes the fall trigger's
   value measurable rather than assumed: it should suppress on ~every
   event of a sharkfin span and ~none of a trough span.

   The morphology is decided ONCE per span, because mixed window geometry
   inside one span is what makes an overlay incoherent - and an overlay of
   incoherent windows is the second defect this was written for.

Units: `x` is in the recording's native units (volts); amplitudes on the
returned events are in mV, matching `detect.py`.

    morphology, because the two boundaries are not the same kind of thing:

      - a sharkfin's left boundary is its OWN rise, so padding outward
        just takes in some quiet lead-in; its right boundary is the NEXT
        event's rise, and padding past that is the very overrun this
        module exists to stop.
      - a trough is the mirror. Its right boundary is its own recovery
        (pad), its left boundary is the PREVIOUS event's recovery (hard).

    So: pad where the boundary belongs to this event, clamp where it
    belongs to a neighbour.

    A NEIGHBOURING FALL IS ALSO A BOUNDARY, and until drop_motifs10 it was
    not. Bracketing on rises alone assumes every event is separated from
    the next by an encoded rise; where two drops are separated by a run

    The fix is `find_trough`'s own knee rule read BACKWARDS. That function
    walks forward from the steepest sample until the slope recovers to
    `knee_frac` of it; this walks back from the same sample until the
    slope was last shallower than that, and takes the first steep sample

    slope threshold, which on a rounded shoulder is already part-way down,
    and every quantity the gates then read - depth, and the rise height
    Gate A compares against it - is measured from part-way down.

    That is drop_motifs10 defect 4, measured. Fig2A CH1, the operator's
    miss at ~904.6 s: the proposal lands at sample 9055 (+0.002 mV), the
    trough at 9058 (-0.120 mV), so the detector sees a 0.086 mV fall and
    `min_depth_frac` rejects it as shallow. The fall actually departs from
    the local maximum at 9051 (+0.046 mV) and is 0.166 mV deep - above the
    0.1 mV instrument floor, which is why the gate does not excuse it.

    This is the same rule `refine9.move_onset` applies to a finished
    store, moved to where it can affect the gates instead of only the
    stored measurement. `refine9` post-processes and can merge, move and
    reject but never ADD, so it could not recover an event the gates had
    already thrown away.

    `backstop` is the earliest sample the walk may reach - the previous
    event's territory. Bounded rather than open-ended because an
    unbounded walk back along a slowly-rising baseline lands on the
    previous cycle's peak, which is the mirror of the runaway

    second fall - if it does, the steepest sample can belong to the
    NEIGHBOUR and the walk then terminates at the neighbour's foot. Measured
    on a three-cycle trough train with a generous fixed limit: onset 400,
    true trough 440, reported trough 861, which is the second spike's
    bottom. The fall duration is then wrong by 10x and every window sized

    THE NEXT RISE IS NOT ENOUGH, and that is defects 3 and 4 of the

                      -> trough 1339, the NEXT drop's foot
                      -> refine_onset walks the onset 36 samples forward
                         to 1332, which IS the next drop
                      -> min_separation then deletes the next drop's own
                         detection as a duplicate of the relocated one.

    Two visible drops became one, four times in that window alone
    (129.6 s, 135.4 s, 140.8 s, 156.2 s), and the same mechanism at CH1
    sample 9055 is the operator's 0.172 mV miss at ~904.6 s.

    So the next FALL bounds the search as well. The bound is gated on
    `min_separation_samples` - the detector's own statement of how far
    apart two detections must be to be two events - because the encoding
    splits one long fall into two runs whenever a single segment lands in
    the `SAME` band (`ddSdd`), and a run that starts within that distance
    is the same event, not the next one. No new parameter.

    THE SAME ACCIDENT HAPPENS UPWARDS, and `rise_separation` is the option
    for it. A very narrow spike whose fall flattens for a single segment
    encodes an UP run inside its own fall; the rises branch then bounds the
    trough search a sample or two past the onset, the depth is measured
    across a fraction of the fall, and Gate B rejects a real event.

    Measured, Mushroom_260720 sample 2661 - a 9 mV spike five samples wide:

        onset 2661 -> limit 2664 (an UP run 2 samples into the fall)
                   -> trough 2662, one sample in
                   -> depth 1.76 mV instead of 8.99
                   -> dominance 0.19 against a 0.5 gate, rejected

    Its inter-onset intervals are what say it is real: the span's drops run
    in a repeating five-step cycle everywhere else, and this one group had
    four steps with a 1214 s gap that the recovered event splits into
    287 + 927 - the cycle every other group has.

    `rise_separation` is OFF by default, because turning it on
    unconditionally would move every store drop_motifs5-12 shipped. See
    `Detect5Params.bracket_rise_on_separation`.
