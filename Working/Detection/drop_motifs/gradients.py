=============
The gradient of each spike's fall, and the circular statistics that turn a
set of gradients into a rose diagram.

What a rose diagram is
----------------------
A rose diagram - equivalently a circular or polar histogram, a wind rose
in meteorology, a strike/dip rose in structural geology - bins a set of
DIRECTIONS and draws each bin as a ray from the centre whose length is the
count in that bin. Here the direction is the angle of a spike's falling
edge and the ray length is how many spikes fall at that steepness, so the
whole population's descent geometry is one picture.

The associated maths is circular statistics: the mean direction is a
`circular_mean` (a vector mean, NOT an arithmetic mean of angles), and how
concentrated the directions are is the `resultant_length` R, from 0 for
"spread evenly" to 1 for "all identical".

The unit trap, which is the whole difficulty
--------------------------------------------
`arctan` takes a dimensionless argument. A slope of -0.73 mV/s has no
angle until something states how many millivolts equal one second ON THE
PAGE. Choosing that reference silently - by writing `arctan(slope)` and
letting the reference default to 1 mV/s unremarked - produces a figure
whose angles are an artefact of a unit choice nobody made deliberately.

So every angle here is `arctan(slope / reference)` with the reference
explicit, reported on the figure, and selectable:

  raw        a stated slope in mV/s (default 1.0). The literal reading:
             45 degrees means "one millivolt per second". Separates the
             two recordings by their absolute steepness, which is a real
             difference and worth showing - Mushroom_260720's falls
             median -4.18 mV/s against M2_aug's -0.73.
  recording  each recording's own median |max slope|. 45 degrees means
             "typical for this recording", so the two roses are directly
             superimposable and what is left is the SPREAD within each.
  pooled     the median over all events pooled. A compromise: one
             reference for everybody, chosen by the data rather than
             stated.
  event      each event's own mean fall slope, making the quantity the
             dimensionless `peakedness` ratio. This is the only mode whose
             angle carries no units at all, and it is the one that answers
             a shape question rather than a scale question.

Which gradient
--------------
Three are measured per event and any can be roseed:

  max_slope    the steepest single sample of the fall. THE default: it is
               what "how vertical is the drop" means, and it is robust to
               where exactly the onset was declared.
  onset_slope  the gradient at the declared onset. Included because it is
               already in the event table, but note it is a poor steepness
               measure on Mushroom_260720 - the onset is the first sample
               past the detection threshold, which on a 2 s segment grid
               can sit one step before the real cliff, so its median
               (-0.088 mV/s) understates the true steepness (-4.18) by a
               factor of fifty.
  mean_slope   depth over fall duration. The average, not the steepest.

Everything is computed from the STORED SNIPPETS, so a rose can be redrawn
from `DATA/derived/drop_motifs/` without re-running detection, exactly
like every other figure in this pipeline.

No plotting library - CLAUDE.md rule 1.
