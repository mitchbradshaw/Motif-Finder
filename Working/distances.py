==============
Three named ways to say two spans are the same shape (T35), each a named
constant rather than an anonymous callable so it can be recorded verbatim
on the `motif_edge` it produces (PIPELINE_PRD.md, "Distances"):

  DISTANCE_SCALE_INVARIANT  Resample both spans to a common length,
                            z-normalise, Euclidean. The primary distance —
                            shape independent of duration.
  DISTANCE_SYMBOLIC         SAX minimum-distance (MINDIST) at a fixed word
                            length. Scale-invariant by construction through
                            piecewise aggregation: reuses the existing SAX
                            ports (`normal_cutlines` for breakpoints,
                            `timeseries2symbol` for the PAA + z-normalise +
                            quantise pipeline it already implements) rather
                            than reimplementing PAA.
  DISTANCE_NATIVE_LENGTH    z-normalised Euclidean at native length (no
                            resampling) — the unnormalised control. Spans
                            of unequal length are compared over their
                            shorter's length, unresampled, so a duration
                            mismatch shows up as a large distance rather
                            than being reconciled away.

`DISTANCE_REGISTRY` maps each name to its function, so a caller (ticket 41)
can look a distance up by the name recorded on an edge rather than storing
a callable.

Elastic distances (e.g. dynamic time warping) are explicitly out of scope
— see PIPELINE_PRD.md's "Distances" paragraph.

    an all-zero array rather than dividing by zero.

    The constant test is `np.ptp(x) == 0`, not `std == 0`. A span of 4.2 mV
    repeated 256 times has a standard deviation of 8.9e-16 rather than 0 —
    `mean()` and `std()` accumulate rounding error that a real flat span
    cannot avoid — so the `std == 0` guard this function used to carry missed
    every constant span except an all-zero one, and divided the rounding dust
    by itself to return a full-amplitude unit-variance waveform of noise.
    `ptp` is a subtraction of two elements and is exact where the variance is
    not, so it recognises the flat span the docstring always claimed to.
