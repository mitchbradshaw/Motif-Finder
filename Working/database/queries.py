==========
Plain functions for reading and writing the annotation database. No ORM,
no session objects — every function takes an open `sqlite3.Connection`
(from `schema.get_connection` / `schema.init_db`) and commits its own writes.

Callable from the UI, from Pipelines/ scripts, or from a plain shell —
nothing here imports a UI library.

Index convention
-----------------
Every `start_idx` / `end_idx` in this module is **channel-local**, never a
concatenated-file global index. Convert once, at import time, with
`global_to_local`.
