chain_validation.py
=====================
One function that answers "can this output type feed this block, and if
not, why not" (PRD "Type checking"). It is consumed at two layers — at
composition, `Working.recipes.make_recipe` rejects an invalid chain before
it is ever hashed or run; at execution, `Working.execution.execute_recipe`
rejects one before the first step runs. Both callers go through
`validate_recipe_steps` below rather than inlining their own compatibility
check, so the two layers cannot drift apart.

The chain's root is always the recording's raw signal, so a step's
"producing type" starts as `ROOT_SIGNAL_KIND` and becomes each step's own
declared `output_kind` for the step after it. A block's declared
`input_kind=None` (see `Adapters.base.AdapterSpec`) means "wants the root
signal", and `ROOT_SIGNAL_KIND` is `"signal"` — the same string as the
`Signal` interchange type — so this module doesn't need a separate
legacy/typed mapping table.
