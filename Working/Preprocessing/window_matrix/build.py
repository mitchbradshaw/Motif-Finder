build.py
=========
The window-matrix builder, headless and resumable
(WINDOW_MATRIX_UI_PROMPT.md §6.3).

This is the checkpoint/resume logic that used to live in
`Pipelines/window_matrix_build/build_window_matrix.py` with `CH`, `FILENAME`,
`WINSIZE`, `FS` and `STEPFRAC` as module-level constants edited per job —
exactly what `HPC/README.md` says not to do, and the reason the HPC export
goes through `run_recipe.py` rather than invoking a script whose parameters
are source edits.

Two things it does that the old builder did not:

1. **`computed` is a real array, not `~isnan(values)`.** A window whose
   feature function raises is recorded as ATTEMPTED, with NaN as its value.
   The old code could not express that: `_pending` looked for NaN, so a
   window that reliably raised was retried on every resumed job forever, and
   `wm_job.sh` — which decides whether to resubmit by grepping `--status`
   for a partial fraction — would resubmit the chain indefinitely. See
   WINDOW_MATRIX_UI_PROMPT.md §0.2.

2. **No truncated tail windows.** The grid stops at the last start that
   admits a full window (see `create_matrix_at_timescale`), so no column
   contains a value computed on a short slice.

Stage-major, not row-major
--------------------------
Windows are processed stage by stage, matching the old builder and letting
the CNN stage batch its GPU forward passes. A timeout therefore leaves
complete COLUMNS and a partial one, rather than complete rows. Either is
fine for resume because the mask is per-cell; stage-major is chosen because
the alternative would force the CNN stage to run one image at a time.
