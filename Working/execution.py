"""
execution.py
=============
Headless recipe execution — the core of part 2. Resolves each step of a
recipe through the adapter registry and runs them in order, each step's
output feeding the next, writing `runs`/`detections` to the database as it
goes. Importable and runnable from a bare script with no Panel installed
(see `run_recipe.py` for the CLI wrapper that part 3's SLURM jobs call).

Nothing here imports a UI library, directly or transitively — `Adapters/`
and `Working/` don't either, so this whole chain stays cluster-safe.

Step cache
----------
The executor caches a step's typed `Working.types` output to
`step_artifacts` when its measured runtime exceeds
`Working.config.STEP_CACHE_WRITE_THRESHOLD_S`. A cached step is restored
through the type's own `from_path` serialiser, never through a per-type
code path.

Interaction with `Working.encoding_cache`: it is **not used by the
executor**. `encoding_cache.py` remains the storage layer for the UI's
encoding-view lookups (SAX/Gramian encodings, keyed by whole-recipe hash).
The step cache stores typed step outputs (the seven `Working.types`) under
a recipe-*prefix* hash; it does not duplicate or replace `encoding_cache`.

    status='failed' with `error_text` (a full traceback) before re-raising.
    Nothing is left half-written.

    Parameters
    ----------
    recipe : dict
        As built by `Working.recipes.make_recipe`.
    db_path : str, optional
        Passed through to `Working.database.schema.init_db`.
    force : bool
        Recompute even if a completed run for this exact recipe already exists.
    on_progress : callable(step_index, n_steps, stage, algorithm), optional
        Called before each step starts. Lets a caller (e.g. a UI background
        thread) show progress without this module knowing how progress is
        displayed.
    should_cancel : callable() -> bool, optional
        Checked before each step. Cancellation is only ever between steps —
        an in-progress numpy/scipy call isn't interrupted mid-flight.
    run_kwargs : dict, optional
        Extra keyword arguments forwarded to `spec.run(...)` for whichever
        steps' `run` callable actually declares them (checked via
        `inspect.signature`, silently dropped for steps that don't — most
        adapters don't and must keep working unmodified). Deliberately NOT
        part of `params`: these are execution-time callables/handles (e.g. a
        finer-grained `on_progress(done, total, stage)` a slow adapter's own
        internal loop can drive — WINDOW_MATRIX_UI_PROMPT.md §6.1), not
        recipe state, so they must never enter `get_or_create_config`'s hash
        or a step's persisted `params`. This is a DIFFERENT progress
        granularity from the `on_progress` above: this module's callback
        fires once per STEP; a step's own `run_kwargs["on_progress"]`, if it
        uses one, fires at whatever finer grain that adapter defines (e.g.
        once per window) — the two must not be conflated into one signature.
    on_step_result : callable(step_index, result), optional
        Called after each step's result lands, with the step index and that
        step's `AdapterResult`. Lets a caller render/emit each stage as it
        completes rather than waiting for the whole run — the "per-stage
        results as they land" behaviour (PIPELINE_PRD.md, Execution). Fires
        for cached and recomputed steps alike, after the step's detections
        and any `persist` artifact have been written, so the callback sees a
        fully-landed stage. This is a distinct channel from `on_progress`
        (before the step) and from `run_kwargs["on_progress"]` (inside the
        step at the adapter's own granularity).

    Returns
    -------
    dict : {
        "run_id": int, "reused": bool, "result": AdapterResult or None,
        "step_timings": {step_index: elapsed_s}, "detections_written": int,
        "config_hash": str,
    }
    `result` is the last step's `AdapterResult` (None for a reused run,
    since nothing was recomputed — read `detections` from the database for
    a reused run's output instead).
