"""Gate 2 — the suite, compared against the run's baseline.

The gate is **no regressions**, never a fixed count: every merged ticket adds
tests, so a hardcoded 486 is wrong by the second merge.

Tracking only the *failing* set is enough to express that. A test that fails now
and did not fail at baseline is a regression; a test that failed at baseline and
still fails is the known-broken state the run started in. Recording the passing
set as well would cost a `-v` run of 486 lines and tell us nothing more.

The **flake amendment** lives here: on red, re-run only the failing node ids,
exactly once. A real regression reproduces every time, so this does not weaken
the gate against anything it exists to catch. What it prevents is a known-flaky
test quarantining innocent tickets and tripping the circuit breaker.
