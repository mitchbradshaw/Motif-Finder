"""
catalogue_classifier.py
========================
Adapter for the last segment of RQ1's chain — a `Grouping` (one label per
window) trained into a `Model` (a reference to a fitted classifier on
disk), over the feature matrix carried by the `WindowSet` those labels
were assigned across.

The chain shape
---------------
`signal -> windowset -> grouping -> model`, which is the PRD's own
statement of it ("the typed chain from signal through window set and
grouping to a model") and the shape
`tests/test_chain_validation.py::test_cnn_chain_validates_end_to_end`
already pins against the validator. `Working.chain_validation` types a
chain as a linear spine, so the step before this one determines its
primary input: after `catalogue.cluster` that is a `Grouping`. The
`WindowSet` therefore arrives as a side input bound to the earlier
window-matrix step, not as the primary input.

Why the label source is a binding and not a parameter
-----------------------------------------------------
RQ1 asks whether cluster-derived labels produce a classifier that
generalises better than manually derived ones. That is only a comparison
if both are trained by the same block. `_run` never asks where its
`Grouping` came from and exposes no parameter that could name it, so
swapping `catalogue.cluster` for a manual-label step upstream changes the
labels and nothing else — no branch, and nothing else to hold equal.

What is reused, and what is not
-------------------------------
`Working/Catalogue/aeon_classification/classification.py` is the reference
for the estimator shape (variance pruning into a balanced random forest)
but is deliberately not called: every entry point there either loads
windows from labelled directories or splits-and-reports rather than
returning a fitted estimator, and none accepts an in-memory feature
matrix. `Working/Catalogue/cnn/apply_cnn.py` is inference over a
pre-trained network, not training. Both are left unmodified.

What *is* reused is `preprocess_window_matrix` — the same feature-matrix
preprocessing `Adapters/catalogue_cluster.py` runs before clustering, so
the classifier and the clustering that labelled it see one feature space.
Two blocks that disagreed about which columns are features would make
their comparison meaningless. It also means Catch22 is not recomputed
here: the window-matrix step already computed it, and these features are
its output.

That module imports matplotlib at module scope for its plotting half, and
sklearn is a second-long import of its own, so both are imported inside
the functions that need them rather than at adapter-import time —
registering this adapter must not drag a plotting backend or a fitted-model
stack into every `discover_adapters()` call.
