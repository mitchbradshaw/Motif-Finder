"""
detection_spike_v1.py
========================
Adapter for `Working.Detection.analysis.spike_analysis.spike_detection_v1`
(Adamatzky 2023 neighbourhood-average spike detector).

Output-kind mismatch, resolved per confirmed policy: `spike_detection_v1`
returns bare spike sample indices (points), not intervals. Converted here
into the segments between consecutive spikes (inter-spike intervals),
bounded by the span's own start/end — same convention as
`detection_rupture.py`.

Note: `compute_spike_statistics` in the same module is an empty stub (no
body) — not wrapped; nothing to call.
