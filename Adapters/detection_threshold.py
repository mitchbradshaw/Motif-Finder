"""
detection_threshold.py
========================
Generic `Scores` -> `SpanSet` block: thresholds a time-aligned `Scores`
(e.g. `detection.matrix_profile`'s output) into the spans where it exceeds
a cutoff. `Working.execution.execute_recipe` writes an `output_kind='spanset'`
result to `detections` directly, so any adapter that declares a `Scores`
output can chain into this one block rather than each detector inventing
its own interval-extraction step (CODING_STANDARDS 3.2's Scores/WindowSet
split is what makes this one generic block possible instead of one per
detector).

Not part of T08's declared file list -- no existing adapter or ticket owns
a generic threshold block (checked `docs/tickets/README.md`'s single-owner
rules), and the ticket's acceptance criteria explicitly require one exists
and is chained end to end from `matrix_profile`. Flagged here for the
reviewer per CLAUDE.md's out-of-scope-file rule.
