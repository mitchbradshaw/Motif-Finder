preprocessing_surrogate.py
===========================
Surrogate generation block (ticket 43). A signal-to-signal adapter that
produces a null — a surrogate version of the input signal — reproducibly
from its recipe. See PRD "Surrogates": phase randomisation and block
shuffling offered as a choice parameter, with an explicit RNG seed among
the parameters so the recipe hash reproduces the surrogate exactly.

Phase randomisation (a Fourier surrogate) preserves the original's power
spectrum by construction: each positive-frequency bin is multiplied by a
unit-magnitude complex exponential, so magnitudes are unchanged and the
inverse FFT is a real signal with the same spectrum. Block shuffling
destroys temporal structure while keeping local amplitude statistics.
