"""
preprocessing_window_matrix.py
================================
Adapter for `Working.Preprocessing.window_matrix.build.build_window_matrix`
— the window matrix as a normal recipe step, so the Run panel builds its
controls automatically and the HPC path goes through `run_recipe.py` rather
than a script with per-job source edits (WINDOW_MATRIX_UI_PROMPT.md §6.3).

`output_kind='windowset'`: the per-window feature matrix rides as attached
features on a `WindowSet`, with no timepoint alignment (CODING_STANDARDS
3.2 — a per-window feature table is not `Scores`). It is what gets cached.
Dendrogram clustering over the matrix is a separate downstream step, not
part of this adapter.

`persist` is declared (see `Adapters.base.AdapterSpec`), so a headless
`run_recipe.py` invocation writes the v1 `.npz` and registers an
`artifacts(kind='encoding')` row on its own — no separate import step, which
is what lets the ladder and the coverage ribbons pick up a cluster run's
output the moment the file comes back.

Resume
------
`resume_path` is a normal recipe parameter, and it is DELIBERATELY set from
the very first export rather than being filled in on the second job: the
artifact path is deterministic from (source stem, channel, window_min,
step_frac), so passing it up front keeps the recipe — and therefore the
config hash — identical across every job in a resubmit chain. A path added
only on resumption would make job 2 a different recipe from job 1, and the
chain would build two half-matrices instead of one whole one.

`execute_recipe` short-circuits on a completed run for the same recipe and
span, so a resuming job must pass `--force`; the generated chain script does.

Progress
--------
`on_progress`/`should_cancel` are plain keyword args on `_run`, not
`ParamSpec` params — they're execution-time callables, not recipe state, so
they must never enter the config hash. `Working.execution.execute_recipe`
forwards them from its own `run_kwargs=` argument (checked against `_run`'s
signature, so every other adapter is unaffected) — see that function's
docstring for why this is a second, finer-grained progress channel from its
own per-STEP `on_progress`, not the same one reused.
