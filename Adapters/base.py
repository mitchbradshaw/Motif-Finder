========
Shared types for the adapter registry. An adapter is the ONLY place that
knows a given `Working/` function's real signature — everything else
(the UI run panel, `execute_recipe`, SLURM job generation in the next
part) talks to adapters through this uniform shape, never to the wrapped
function directly.

Adding an algorithm later means writing one new adapter file (see
`Adapters/README.md`-style docstrings at the top of any existing adapter
for the pattern) and registering it — zero changes anywhere else.

class AdapterSpec:
    """Everything the rest of the system needs to know about one algorithm.

    Attributes
    ----------
    name : str
        Unique registry key, "<stage>.<short_name>", e.g. "preprocessing.lowpass".
    display_name : str
        Human-readable label for the UI.
    stage : str
        One of `Working.recipes.STAGES`.
    params : list[ParamSpec]
    run : callable(x, t, fs, **params) -> AdapterResult
        Always called with the full (x, t, fs) triple regardless of
        whether the underlying function needs all three — the adapter
        decides what to actually forward. This is the "map (x, t, params)
        onto the underlying function" the brief asks for; that mapping
        lives entirely inside `run`, nowhere else.
    output_kind : str
        One of the seven `TYPE_KINDS` (the contents of `OUTPUT_KINDS`). The
        legacy `intervals` output vocabulary is gone; `signal` and
        `encoding` survive as the type names they already coincided with.
    input_kind : str
        One of `TYPE_KINDS` — the primary input this step expects. Defaults
        to `'signal'`, the chain's root; `None` is refused (stage-3 block
        standard, `docs/BLOCK_INTEGRATION.md`): a root-signal block says
        `'signal'`, the same string `Working.chain_validation` uses, so the
        type system has one vocabulary and no "unset" state.
    side_inputs : list[SideInputSpec]
        Additional typed inputs beyond the primary one, e.g. a clustering
        step's library exemplar. Bound to an actual value at chain-
        composition time (PRD "Chain shape"); declared here only. Empty
        list (the default, and every existing adapter) means "no side
        inputs".
    estimate : callable(x, t, fs, **params) -> float, optional
        Predicted runtime in seconds for the span about to be analysed,
        used to warn before a long run. None (the default, and every
        existing adapter) means "counts as free".
    plot : callable(x, t, result, **params) -> matplotlib.figure.Figure, optional
        None if this algorithm has no natural single-run visualisation.
    detail_view : callable(result, **params) -> HoloViews element/layout, optional
        Opt-in, per-adapter focus view. Focus mode calls this when a block
        declares one, and falls back to the single type renderer for the
        step's input and output when it does not. None (the default, and
        every existing adapter at registration time) means "no per-adapter
        focus view". The callable itself is UI-side: the spec carries the
        hook so focus mode can route through it without switching on an
        algorithm's type or name.
    max_span_samples : int, optional
        Declared, not enforced here — `Working.execution.execute_recipe`
        checks `len(x) <= max_span_samples` before calling `run` and
        refuses with a clear message otherwise. None means unbounded.
        Set this on any O(n^2)-or-worse encoding (e.g. Gramian/recurrence)
        so the guard is real and can't be forgotten per-call-site.
    description : str
        Longer description, shown in the run panel / adapter listing.
    category : str
        Which insert-modal tab the block files under — one of `CATEGORIES`.
        Required; an unknown value is refused loudly (the bridge used to
        keep a side table and default the unknown to "control").
    page_name : str, optional
        What the concept pages call the block ("Baseline removal" for
        `preprocessing.detrend`). Defaults to `display_name`.
    known_broken : str, optional
        Set when the block is registered but known not to run on this
        machine (e.g. a dependency that no longer imports). The reason is
        shown on the block's card and the insert modal; the block stays
        listed so the researcher sees what exists and why it is unavailable.
    recommend : callable(x, t, fs) -> dict, optional
        Suggested param VALUES for the span about to be analysed (2026-08,
        Part 2a) — e.g. "how many seconds per symbol" depends on how long
        the span is, so a fixed default is wrong for most spans. Returns a
        dict of {param_name: value} overriding `ParamSpec.default` for
        whichever params it wants to (a subset is fine). None means "no
        span-aware defaults" — every existing adapter keeps its plain
        static `ParamSpec.default`s.
    derive : callable(x, t, fs, params) -> list[(label, value, severity)], optional
        Read-only diagnostic rows to show BESIDE the parameter controls,
        recomputed live as the user edits them, without running anything —
        e.g. "Symbols produced: 256" from a "seconds per symbol" control a
        human can't otherwise picture the effect of. `severity` is one of
        `""`, `"warn"`, `"error"` for styling. Deliberately NOT part of
        `ParamSpec`: a `ParamSpec` means "a tunable input" and mixing a
        read-only readout into that list would make `validate_params`
        reject it as an "unknown param" (or, if given a matching name,
        silently accept it as tunable, which it isn't). None means no
        derived readout.
    persist : callable(conn, run_id, config_hash, recording, span_start, span_end, params, result) -> str | None, optional
        Opt-in hook for an 'encoding' step whose output should be written
        to disk and registered as an `artifacts(kind='encoding')` row
        automatically, with no separate UI action or import step —
        `Working.execution.execute_recipe` calls this (if set) right after
        a successful 'encoding' step and inserts the returned path via
        `Working.database.runs.insert_artifact`. None (the default, and
        every existing adapter) means "caching this output is a separate,
        explicit decision" per `execute_recipe`'s normal contract. Matrix
        profile sets this so a headless `run_recipe.py` invocation (e.g.
        an HPC job, MATRIX_PROFILE_UI_PROMPT.md §5) produces a browsable
        artifact on its own.
