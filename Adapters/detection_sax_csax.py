detection_sax_csax.py
========================
Adapter for `Working.Detection.sax.csax_python.csax.csax`, called
directly (not through `make_csax_encoder`, which hides `return_details`)
so the adapter can surface the encoding internals the UI's encoding view
needs (Part 3, 2026-08).

Parameter surface (Part 2, 2026-08 rewrite): `dim_ratio` is no longer the
primary control — see `Adapters._sax_common`'s module docstring for why
and how `segment_mode` resolves to it. cSAX does not take an alphabet
size (Mean-Shift decides it); the realised count is surfaced through
`details["alphabet_size"]` in the run panel's post-run diagnostics
instead of a pre-run control.
