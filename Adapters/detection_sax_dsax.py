detection_sax_dsax.py
========================
Adapter for `Working.Detection.sax.dsax_python.dsax.dsax` — dSAX encodes
each PAA-aligned segment by its TREND (the rise across the segment)
instead of its mean, into a zero-anchored DOWN/SAME/UP alphabet quantised
by the same Epanechnikov-KDE + Lloyd-Max machinery pSAX uses. Segmentation
is resolved through the shared `segment_plan` exactly as in
`detection_sax_csax.py`/`detection_sax_psax.py`, so all three encoders can
never disagree about what "20 seconds per symbol" means.

`plot` points at `plot_trend_encoding`, NOT the shared
`plot_encoding_matplotlib`, and that is not an oversight. The shared
renderer draws `cutlines_raw` as horizontal amplitude bands behind
`paa_raw`; dSAX's cutlines are a threshold on a RISE, in amplitude per
segment, while `paa_raw` is a level. Drawn on one y axis they are two
quantities of different dimension, and on a real fungal channel (tens of
mV of standing potential against sub-mV excursions) the delta cutlines
collapse to a sliver near zero — a figure that looks like a dSAX bug and
is in fact a category error. The interactive encoding view resolves the
same problem at runtime through `UI.plots.cutline_domain`, which reads the
`cutline_domain` key this encoder declares in its `details`.

See `Working/Detection/sax/dsax_python/IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md` for the
method, its prior art, and its measured limitations — in particular 6.3
(MSE-optimal Lloyd-Max is not a noise floor) and 7.3 (untreated drift
swamps a trend encoding), both of which this adapter surfaces through
`delta_diagnostic_rows` below.
