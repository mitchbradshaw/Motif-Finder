detection_dehshibi_spikes.py
==============================
Adapter for `Working.Detection.analysis.dehshibi_detection_analysis.detect_spikes`
(Dehshibi & Adamatzky 2021 full spike-detection pipeline).

Good native fit: `detect_spikes` already returns `(spikes, pseudo_spikes, info)`
with `spikes`/`pseudo_spikes` as `(start, end)` tuples — real intervals, no
point-to-segment conversion needed (unlike `detection_rupture.py` /
`detection_spike_v1.py`).

Only the parameters a user would plausibly want to tune are exposed
(`n_p`, `min_spike_duration`, `min_roi_wavelet`, `epsilon_factor`); the
Morse-wavelet constants (`beta`, `gamma`, `eta`) are paper-fixed and left
at their defaults rather than cluttering the auto-generated form with
physics internals nobody adjusts in practice.

This pipeline is the most compute-heavy adapter in this set (Morse wavelet
transform + envelope extraction per histogram-sliced chunk) — exactly the
kind of step whose per-step duration (recorded by `execute_recipe`) is
meant to surface "this belongs on the cluster, not interactively".
